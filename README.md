2. Text insights report
  * Report 1-2 insights that you obtained from conducting your descriptive analytics report.
  * Report a recommendation that you will advice a customer when deciding about a product you analyzed.
  
You need to submit the report in Blackboard and in your code repository. Finally, **do not forget** to submit all the code you use for your analysis, and that will be needed to replicate your work in the code repository.
