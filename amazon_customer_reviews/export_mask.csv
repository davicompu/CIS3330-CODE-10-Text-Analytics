  These were exactly what I was looking for! I was using disposable and they were twice as hot. They are super comfortable and soft and dip at the cheekbones like I wanted.

  These are the best masks I’ve found! I ordered the XL size to fit my ample dome. I have a HUGE face and my beard only exacerbates things. Hat size 7 5/8”, beard is usually 5-6” off my chin. How HUGE is your face if these masks are too small?  You must be a cartoon or some sort of animated caricatures. These masks would fit Jay Leno’s chin! These masks would cover Adrian Brodie’s big ol’ honker! These masks would even fit OJ Simpson’s gargantuan noggin! Great buy, and I would buy again!

  I’ve been through about 6 masks now and I’ve FINALLY found comfort and breathability. If I have to wear a mask, it’s got to be comfortable! I’m an essential worker in a warehouse but also am out and about quite a bit and I needed a reusable and washable safety mask. First of all, this mask is so soft, and secondly it is 3 PLY which gives great protection as well...BUT the real value prop with this mask is the ear loops. The loops that come off this mask are circular and elastic and very comfortable. The previous masks I used had square shaped elastic bands that went behind my ears which were incredibly uncomfortable and gave me Dumbo ears (not a good look) I also like that it’s a three pack. I did purchase an XL because I have a beard and a larger face, it’s nice they have a size chart in their images and a few different sizes, this one is good you won’t be disappointed!

  I like that these masks fit really comfortably on my face. I don’t feel like it's squishing my nose, but it also has a decently tight fit. It also doesn’t pull on my ears like a previous one that I had. I know it isn’t the time to care about these things...but I looked seriously ridiculous with my ears poking out! They are made of really nice 3 PLY fabric, very happy with this .

  I have a pretty fat face, so have trouble buying one-size-fits-all masks, but these fit very well. I can talk or open my mouth a normal a little without it sliding off my nose or chin. The tapered nose fits well and doesnt leave a huge gap (I also have a honker of a nose). The fabric is soft and comfortable, doesnt feel suffocating. I washed in a lingerie bag on warm, and then tumble-dried on medium and there was no shrinkage or damage.  No unpleasant smell or feel. Would buy again.

  I have a big head, and usually need an XL hat. These masks fit perfectly and feel very nice. Even if you head is a little smaller these will fit fine and not kill your ears. Very recommended.

  Very flexible. The material is breathable enough that I don't feel like I am suffocating. The shape is also really good and it fits over my face very well. I definitely recommend washing them first thing, it helps them fit better and I found they can shrink a bit for a tighter fit on the face.They also are easy to pack up and take on the go and I like the color. It's very simple and sleek and is super useful.

  I just the got the XL facemasks in. They could still use to be a bit bigger. The nose section will come off when talking/yawning and the elastic is a bit of a stretch to get around your ears and feels quite thin. these are still going to hurt to wear for long stretches, but better than any other option that I've tried. If you have a big head/face, this is probably your best bet.

  I like that they have 3 different sizes. I ordered the large and it fits very comfortably without wanting to slide up or down my face while talking. They are made from a very soft material, and you can feel the 3 layers of fabric in it. The elastic loops for the ears are very stretchy, an long enough that you don't get any pull on your ears.

  I have looked at, purchased and returned several masks (or given them away) becuase NOTHING ever fits right..  These do, and they are pretty comfortable as well.  The elastic is a little less stretchy but I can put these on and talk without having to pull them up every 2 words.  Covers everything that needs to be covered and stays put, thank you!

  These masks are great. Excellent quality, leave you room to breath and yet they are thick enough to protect you. I believe it could be a little thicker, actually, but it should do the trick. I am a 5.1 female and I got medium after reading a few reviews. I believe I could have gotten the small ones, as it feels a bit loose in my face. For reference, I have a thin, oval face and weight 103 pounds.

  I purchased the small size for my 11 year old and it fits perfectly. Not too tight that it’s pulling at the ears but definitely not leaving gaps. Material is thick but stretchy. For reference, she’s definitely on the small side but overall I think this could comfortably fit kids that are a little older.

I was desperately in need of a mask that I could wear during my CrossFit workouts and this wins!  I don’t suck in cloth when working out and it stays put on my face without falling down or creeping up into my eye sockets.  I ordered three more  since I absolutely must wash them after each use.

  **Updated review** (A second masks elastic just snapped) I hand washed them once and couldn't shrink them. After further inspection before hand washing I noticed one of the ear bands is torn and about to split in complete half. See in photos. The large is way to big for me and I definitely need a medium. The company is asking me to send a photo of the defective item but there is no attachment option on my app or mobil Amazon site. Therefore I'm posting the defective item on here for the company to see. ....OLD REVIEW..Nice soft comfortable but not a tight enough seal around my face. I'm a woman with a normal sized face and I just need it tighter. **update- The large mask sucked into my nose/mouth when I inhale. I have bought the medium size and no longer have issues. I recommend the medium size if you have issues like me. A proper fitting mask can do wonders.

My wife is also 68 with asthma, high blood pressure and a heart condition.  My son and I are both over 6 feet tall and have full beards.  Obviously it is of utmost importance that we are protected when we take necessary trips to the grocery store and the like.  We don't want want to be exposed to the virus and bring it home.  The standard adult mask doesn't quite give us the needed coverage to fully protect us.  Before I found these, I had to make my own over sized masks.  As you can see in the picture,  these masks cover my face from the bridge of my nose to the beard on my chin.  Adding my glasses and a hat gives me the protection I need to go out into the world.

  They came just as pictured and described. They comfortably fit our 10 year old around the ears-no pulling, and snugly around the face. The 3 layers were still easy for him to breath through and we had no trouble with them in the washer. Great buy. I'd say the kids size fits 4-11 years old.

  Pros:I live in New York. So mandatory masks has been going on since April. I have tried so many masks. These masks are very comfortable. Fits perfectly. I got a large and feels wonderful. Comfortable. Breathable and Stretchable.Cons:Failed the flame test. If you want to know if your mask is doing a good job protecting you and others. Get a lighted match. Put on the mask and cough much as you can. With this mask I knocked out the flame on my third try and the flame goes everywhere every time.  That means micro droplets can fly out your mouth and into the air and vice versa.Conclusion:These masks feels good but in the protective category it is troubling. Best bet is to double up these masks. I did that and the flame never moved. I can still breath and feel comfortable with two on. Or combined with a surgical mask they sell at the pharmacy. Wearing these singles is risky.

I took a chance on these masks for the price and the good reviews and I was not disappointed. Very soft and durable, soft ear loops...love the bright, clean white! No more flat masks with pleats for me...I will order another set of these! If your face is a little round or larger like mine, I would recommend the XL...have yet to wash and dry mine, but if they shrink a little they should still fit great.

  I ordered these because I am a bit larger than average...  6 foot 4 inches  255 lbs... the standard mask barely covers my face... these are roughly the same size as medium masks, but the straps are SHORTER.... making them LESS COMFORTABLE than standard masks...

  I got the size large because that's what it suggested for normal size adults. I guess I'm not ""normal"" sized. I should have got a size medium instead of large. The large is just too big on my face and there is a huge gap under my chin so it doesn't feel like it is protecting me like it should. I should also mention it was still too big after washing and drying it and trying to shrink it. Which it did shrink a little bit but not enough. It is soft and comfortable but does not feel protective and foggs up my sunglasses when I wear it.

  We ordered a package of small for my two youngest children (6 and 11, both petite) and medium for my son and myself (13 and petite adult).  The mask fit well along our faces--we like that it dips down a little so that we could see some of our cheeks, and they look very nice.  But the ear straps didn't fit well.  They're a little on the longer side, and  after tightening them a little by twisting them or putting a knot, they dig into the back of our ears.  These will work well for shorter periods but we probably can't wear these all day.

  I like almost everything about these masks.Only the height of the mask is different between the S, M, and L masks.  The distance from ear to ear is exactly the same which is frustrating as I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and buying different sizes if I had known that.The small fit my thin 8 yo boy fine for height but I had to tie a slip knot in the ear loops so the mask will stay up. I may consider racking them with sewing thread after we figure out what size will be comfortable for a full day a camp.

  I bought these because they're on almost every single """"Best breathable, lightweight, moisture-wicking, etc. masks"" list (Rolling Stone, Good Housekeeping, etc.) Do NOT believe the hype. I hand-washed them very well (soap/rinse cycle 3x) using a Scrubba bag (THOSE are great) as soon as they came in, using Seventh Generation no scent detergent. For some reason, these smell like garlic or vinegar. It's definitely not my breath either because I've never had this happen and have been wearing masks every day since April. And, they're HOT. They're even hotter than the paper masks. My face drips sweat underneath these masks. These also made me realize that while they may be moisture-wicking, they definitely are not lightweight and/or breathable. Regarding size/fit, I measured my face per their instructions, and even though I was on the cusp between the Medium and the Large, I got the Large. Even with the Large, if I open my mouth to yawn, the mask slips down below my nose every single time. Lastly, and most important, these hurt behind my ears. It looks like it's going to be soft and pliable, but something about them makes them pull and hurt. Bottom line? Do not buy.

  I’ve tried other “xl” masks that were no such.  This XL fits over my big sexy face & my big sexy beard.  Thanks to the manufacturer - I don’t have to resort to veterinary optionsUpdate - wore this for a brisk walk with the dog.  NOT for athletic use.  This mask is thick & well-made & it absorbs every drop of sweat it touches & holds it tightly around your mouth & nose.  Had to call it after mile 1/2 (of customary 4).  These are larger & fit better than most others, but I’ll only be using these for sedentary pursuits.  I’ve found adidas masks are slightly smaller but MUCH more suited for use while moving.

  The masks are generously cut and sized, the fabric was nice, and they fit much better than the common ""one size fits all"" products available. The one disappointment was the polyester blend fabric. It's not as easy to breathe through and I find my face starting to perspire and getting hot after a few minutes. This may improve after a few washings, but there's nothing, that can beat the comfort of 100% cotton, esp. around your face. Maybe this company will offer a 100% cotton version of this XL mask in the future for the ultimate reusable mask. Additionally, these masks lack a metal nose piece, and there are gaps present between the bridge of the nose and either cheek. I might harvest a nose piece before I throw away the next one and figure out a way to use it on these masks. Despite the cons, these masks deserve 4 stars.

  The mask is made in Vietnam.  The quality of stitching and material is very good.  While it states on the insert that it is a non-medical device, if everyone wore a mask like this, it would help prevent the spread of disease if a person coughs or sneezes out in public by preventing the aerosol droplets to go as far.  I found it very comfortable to wear.

  First, I like most of the qualities of this mask.It’s soft, and the material that goes behind the ears is also soft and stretchy. It’s breathable, so it doesn’t get overly hot when wearing it for extended periods. My kids also like it and will wear it, which is really important with school starting part-time again.I knew the masks didn’t have nose-wires, and I plan on adding my own. But the major drawback is sizing. I ordered according to the size chart, and the masks are much too big. By measurements, the large should have fit me and my oldest, and the medium should have fit my youngest. Instead, the medium fits me and my oldest, and the small fits my youngest. So I basically ended up paying twice for the masks. Definitely size down when you buy these.

  To be fair, I haven't been in public since March 13 so I have not had an occasion to wear a mask yet during the pandemic. I will be returning to the office over the next few/several months so I knew I needed something. After reading tons of reviews I settled on this pack. I just tried one on and it is very comfortable, fits my face well (I ordered a large and have a normal sized female adult face), and it is much more lightweight than I was expecting. Covers my whole face well and doesn't fall off. Not looking forward to wearing it 8 hours a day but I think it is going to work just fine.

  These are soft and comfortable but a little difficult to breath in. I see people complaining they are not 3 ply.  I doubt that because if they were any thicker,  you would not be able to breath.

Because of this I would not recommend to eye glass wearers. I will keep for family members but keep looking for me.

  The Texas heat makes some face masks hot and uncomfortable, even though we MUST wear them. My son who is going to his work place 5 days a week, has a large size head & shaves it. On other masks, some straps are tight, the sides of the mask don't go close enough to his ear to provide good coverage, and some fabrics that are difficult to breath in. This mask is as described. First of all, the 3 layers of fabric provide recommended coverage (not optimum), they are light and easier to breathe in.  But most amazing, is the fit.  It is wide enough to provide better coverage from ear to ear. The slight stretch of the fabric provides a better fit and increased comfort. It is reasonably priced and washable, making it a good value for a product we may need for the unforeseeable future.  I REALLY wish there was a filter pocket in these for more optimum protection, but for now the comfort will allow wearing longer than the disposable masks with better comfort.

  I first purchased this product earlier in the summer because I needed an XL face covering. The black ones I received quickly became my go-to masks. The size is right, they look good, are appropriate for office work, and the hold up well to repeated washing. And as a bonus, though they're multi-layer masks, they fold up small enough to fit in a pocket, so I always have one with me. I ordered three of the blue version this time, and this time I was disappointed. They are, if anything, softer than the black ones, but the ear pieces are less comfortable (haven't yet determined if they're shorter or just more irritating material), they fit more loosely, and perhaps most annoyingly, the middle seam is significantly off-center. This varies by mask. One is close to center, the other more clearly off, and the third way off. Not only do they look wrong, but they pull to one side, and I've caught myself more than once trying to adjust them, so the production error leads to more hand-to-mask contact. I've taken the two out of rotation. The first ones I bought were easy five-star masks. The more recent ones, unfortunately, are not.

  There are several reviews saying these are sized too small...perhaps other buyers were shipped the wrong item?  I wear XL hats, I'm 6 feet tall, and I have a full beard (not close-trimmed and sculpted).  One of my best friends has been calling me ""Big Head"" for years.  With the XL masks I was shipped there is absolutely no problem covering from under my chin to the bridge of my nose just under my glasses, even with my fluffy beard.  There's plenty of length in the ear straps so they are not pulled too tight.  When I move my jaw to talk everything stays covered.  I like the way they have a 3D shape to stand out over the mouth, unlike flat masks that are easily drawn in when inhaling.

  I made the mistake of getting the white masks. While they are comfortable and fit well, they look exactly like underwear. It’s basically like wearing a jock strap.

  These are probably the softest masks I've experienced yet against my skin and I was SO glad to find a company that does actual sizes! Especially since my husband needed an XL for his beard. SADLY THOUGH, there is no nose wire!! GAH!! It would have been five stars, raving from the rooftops if so! But sadly, it does not, which gives a lot of space above the mask for air to get in and out and I was CONSTANTLY having to pull it back up when talking bc it would slide down below my nose...which defeats the purpose of not touching your mask and keeping you safely covered at all times. I also got a set for my husband who works out a lot outside, hoping it would be a more comfortable option, but alas,  he had the same issues with it sliding down and said it was HOT to keep on outside. So I guess the take away is if you don't care about the nose wire, you won't be speaking in it, and you don't need it for outside, it is a good option. (I do highly recommend, however, that the company makes it clear that there is no nose wire in the mask. I did hours of research and when I got to these, I thought my prayers had been answered because it looked so structured, I assumed there HAD to be a wire in it.) :(

  I have purchased several face coverings and they did not properly cover my mouth and nose. For men with ""fuller brained heads"", a larger mask is vital. This mask fit well and is comfortable against my skin. I washed it as instructed in my washing machine and it held up well. I am very pleased with this product.

  I purchased these for myself and my twin teenagers. They fit perfectly for myself and the kids, but too small for my husband so I ordered him a large...should be here tomorrow. These are very nice...thin so you're able to breathe comfortably. Washable and water resistant. Earloops are very comfortable. I could easily wear this one all day. My daughter plays softball and has to wear a mask when they are in the weight room together. Medical masks are not working as she cannot look down and see her feet...the other cloth one was so thick she couldn't breathe...these are perfect. They said 1-day shipping and I think they would have made it in one day if they hadn't left the shipping center and then gone back to the shipping center that same day. Still arrived in 2 days so I'm not mad...

  I am a large guy but followed the direction for sizing. I was on the upper end of the ""large"" but ordered that given some reviews said the mask was loose even when properly ordered. I measured 5.5 inches and the large was supposed to be OK up to 5.75 inches. The mask did not fit, barely covered my nose and mouth. Clearly would not stay in place. the quality seems good so I ordered the XL and will return these. I will update my review after I get the larger ones.

  These do not work for me at all, because there is not a good seal around my nose and my glasses fog up immediately.  Glasses wearers need a bendable nose piece to create a good seal and these do not have this essential feature.  I give them 3 stars anyway, because these masks would be OK for people without glasses.  I wish I had read the questions.

  I’ve bought a few different styles of face coverings/face masks since the COVID19 pandemic began. Unfortunately, most were just too small for my face and pulled my ears forward or pushed my nose down, both uncomfortable.I searched for larger masks and found these. The quality is superior to the smaller masks, and the size is perfect for an average or larger adult male’s face. I also have a large beard, which these help cover. Though my beard hangs beneath the mask, they are built to help tuck in the beard under your chin for a closer/safer fit.Shipping was quick, and items were packaged nicely. If I have to order additional masks, this would be my choice. I’d definitely do business with this company again.Note: Image shows package opened with one mask removed.

  We washed these masks upon receiving them and they stayed in their normal shape, no shrinkage.The masks are very soft and comfortable. The ear loops are as well. They are easy to breath in and fit both men and women alike, as My husband wore one and he really likes it . We put the mask to the light challenge and no light came through the mask, we then lite a match and with the mask on tried to blow out the flame and could not . We have tried this with other masks and some have failed miserable, but not this one. If they had other colors we would for sure purchase another set or two to have one for daily use.  We were pleasantly surprised and are very happy with out purchase.

  By now I have tried a great number of facemasks, homemade and not.  As I will be teaching all day in a mask, it was imperative that I be able to breathe and speak well with the mask on - and that the fit is comfortable, as well as a good fit for protection.  This mask is the best I have found and tried by far. There is a nice ""air pocket"" around the mouth and nose, which helps one feel their breathing is not being restricted (it may only be mental, but for me it matters). It is also apparent these masks give a good amt. of protection and are well made.  I was able to easily dye the white ones to match our school colors; even did one as a tie dye. I give these masks a solid five stars.

  I have a big head and face. The disposable paper masks have rarely covered my mouth and nose as well as I wanted. But after trying many bandanna type gaiters; I also found that they were almost always too small. This set of larger fabric masks are much better for me. They are made well with layers and strong abilities to stretch. The only thing that was missing were the nose reinforced soft metal that allows for a simple adjustable helpful ‘stay put’ moldable piece. I remedied this with purchasing some soft metal set of these nose pieces with a bit of adhesive. Combined the larger masks with the separate metal nose piece... created a very improved experience. Where whatever you can find and/or upgrade for your ability to wear. These masks are really good; but I don’t like the way any mask makes me feel like I am not breathing right. But I also have been through the COVID virus infection experience. I have been blessed to be able to avoid hospitalization. But keep searching for these strange additions to our safety needs. These are easy to clean and with the increased amount of accessories (like the nose holders); I am heartened that this strange world of masks will continue to adapt to make the experience less of a pain to find and then to wear. Blessings and stay safe.

  Masks were disappointing, so close to being great. I thought I had a large sized face, most of the masks I've bought online are always way too small. Ordered these in the XL and they were huge and baggy on my face and my boyfriend's larger face aswell. Not too much of a problem as we could just tie the ear loops smaller to make the mask tight around the face, and that seemed to work. It has good coverage from about under the eye to under your chin. While they are soft, and a good material, they are basically worthless. We did the lighter test to them (where you hold a flame infront of your mask and blow, if the flame doesn't move that means your mask is safe). We didn't even blow that hard and the flame moved around alot, meaning these masks are not very protective. They don't have a filter pocket either so I'm going to have to either make my own filter pocket or wear a surgical mask under it for the protection we need. I'm SO disappointed as the reviews all seemed great- but these masks are not CDC standard safe and was sadly a waste of my money :/

  I just received these today and I could not believe the quality, thickness, breathability and softness!! I was wondering if I’d ever find a face mask with each of these things within my budget.I, like millions, lost my job due to Covid and I have to be very mindful of my spending. I have been trying to find a mask that I could wear for hours, but could also afford and reuse. Unfortunately, it took a lot of research and trial and error before I found these masks.Due to my compromised health issues I will continue to wear a mask. I needed to eventually find a comfortable one, since it appears face masks will be in my future for quite sometime, so I’m excited to have found these masks.In fact, I just put them in the washer so I can start to officially wear them.I purchased the white, large size not because I’m a large person but because I have a hard time breathing in face masks to the point I was even having anxiety attacks when wearing them. I had read that if you can get a ‘sized’ face mask instead of the one-size-fits-all version you can size it to allow for a bit more room to breathe. That turns out to be true.Plus, the style of this mask does not fit across your mouth which helps, but the larger size gives me just enough extra room that I can breathe easily.The ear loops and mask are so soft that I felt very comfortable in it so that helps with the anxiety too.I highly recommend this mask. In fact, since I can’t sew and never will, I will be coming back for more of these masks.

  These masks have been great overall, and are much more comfortable and higher quality than others I own. However, I don't understand why any mask would come without some kind of nose bridge piece to keep it in place. I am constantly having to adjust it into position as, due to being male and having stubble on my face, it pulls down if I'm doing anything else but breathing through my nose. I have gone ahead and ordered my own nose pieces that I'll try to fasten myself, but these should be a must. Having a mask that you need to constantly touch to adjust partially defeats the health benefits of such a mask. If this mask were to have a nose bridge to better hold it in place, I could easily be convinced to give five starts considering price, material, and number of masks.

  The mask is relatively comfortable and its 3 ply fabric prevents one from blowing out a candle to give an indication of its effectiveness; however, the area around the nose bridge leaves gaps preventing a good ""seal""; there is no metal or plastic to form around your nose bridge (the gap is a serious issue when relying upon this mask in these virus times).

We also have ones we bought from a department store (2 layer with filter pocket) and disposable non-surgical masks.They are comfortable, easy to use, and should provide more filtration than the homemade t-shirt ones we made at the start of stay-at-home in March.Still on the lookout for N95s.

  Nice quality material, really soft and well sewn.  Horrible smell; I'll wash and see whether that mitigates it.  Ear straps are super comfy and it conforms to face well other than the height, i.e., its main problem is that it doesn't cup down under chin, or if you try to make it do so, you pull it down off nose.  This is for a medium size.  I think a contributing problem is not having a wired portion for the bridge of the nose.  Even if it had that, however, mask would still be too short to fit our 12-year-old or me--I'm about same size (5'3"" small boned female) although with different face shape.  Way too short to fit our older teenager or my husband.  If I can get the smell out, i'll consider buying a size up, although lack of wire might be a deal-breaker since there's no significant elastic anywhere to help keep it on (i.e., the material itself is a knit, which gives it some stretch, but that's not enough on its own to keep it up).  First thing is to get rid of the smell . . . and i'm not really that sensitive to smells; this one is just that bad.

  When I tell you don’t hesitate to buy this mask. I mean really don’t. This exceeded my expectations. It was comfortable, stylish, light weight, everything I could ever want in a mask. Aside from all of the other sketchy looking black masks on amazon with the questionable reviews, this one was the only one that looked reputable enough for me to take the risk and buy. I have a pretty normal sized face, and so does my mom and brother, and the large fit us all perfectly. It even got delivered the next day. Such a great mask I couldn’t be happier.

  I’ve tried a number of masks and this one is my favorite so far. I had to lightly pull at the ear loops to stretch them out a bit for comfort and it did the job. I have a thinly trimmed beard and it worked well with that. It’s a little tough to breathe through when you wear it for a prolonged period, but I was out in the hit Florida sun for hours in it. The heat down here is suffocating even without a mask.

  I've wasted way so much money on masks that don't fit. The masks would slip down my nose and when I pulled it up, it would slip up over my chin. Super annoying when you're trying not to touch your face. These masks cover my whole face without having to shift it around. I'm so happy the other reviews weren't fake. I gave it four stars so it wouldn't look like a scam but these really are five stars.

  Mine came in the mail yesterday. I went for a 2.5 mile walk this morning and I liked the feel and breathability. I don't wear a mask the whole walk, only on busy streets so I only wore it for 5-10 minutes at a time but this is the most breathable cloth mask I've tried. I have a small/narrow head and so the ear loops on most masks are too long for me, so I ordered these masks in medium and they fit well for regular every day use but aren't long enough to be able to tuck up under my sunglasses while still reaching the bottom of my chin well (this might not be as much of an issue with a different style glasses, or a face not quite as long as mine). The medium fits perfectly when worn normally without pulling it up for glasses. It's my new favorite, but I ordered another set today in large for exercising.

  I ordered a Medium, as 5’4” young adult woman with an average (not small) face & strong nose bridge.From top of nose bridge to bottom of chin was ~5”, so by the size chart I should be a Large... But I was tired of oversized masks that move around my mouth when I breath or talk, or that completely erase the shape of my face or jaw. Call me vain, but Covid’s been here long enough that masks shouldn’t look like shapeless fabric bags anymore.So, I read some other reviews and decided to try the Medium for a better “fit”. Thankfully, it wasn’t too small, is very comfortable, and has a much better fit/shape than others I’ve tried.Pros:Soft fabric & very stretchy ear bands helps it lie flat against my cheeks without gapping or pulling on my ears.Reaches just below my chin for safety, but not halfway down my neck like many others.Black fabric inside and out, so it won’t show gross stains, sweat, or makeup when you take it off.I haven’t noticed any tears or irregularities on my 3 masks.Cons:Gaps between my nose and upper cheeks, but that’s not surprising considering the height of my nose bridge, and the lack of a nose wire.(Mask hack: the way the seams are made, you can probably make a small cut on one side and thread a paper clip or twist tie into the top seam. I’ve done it for another mask by DewArmor, and it works great.)The curve of the front seam is a liiiittle bit too round/extended for my tastes, but that’s just me being picky. It means the fabric still inflates and deflates a bit when you breath or talk, but still less than other fabric masks I’ve tried.

  So first impressions are it fits great, good material, ear loops not too tight... but then the more I started wearing them, I realized they were kind of unusable at this point because they keep moving down when I'm talking to people and I have to readjust it over my nose CONSTANTLY. I got a size large because I feel like I have a pretty normal male face/head and that was the size recommendation but it just doesn't keep a good level of tightness on the top part so it keeps uncovering my nose. I already washed and wore them, so kinda lost out of the money. So just warning for others, I'm not sure if a smaller size will fix it, but maybe go medium if you're not a giant dude?

  In mid-July I purchased a package of the ""Large"" in Black. They fit and seal perfectly around nose and mouth. They are very breathable and comfortable, and stretch perfectly, and do not gap or leave any openings for air to seep in or out. They have three layers of material. They are my favorite mask...UNTIL I decided to buy another pack of Large Black later in July, and in August, and those Larges were much bigger! I would say the ""new"" Large is more like an Extra Large. I can only imagine how huge the Extra Large size must be! Recently I ordered the Medium, thinking that the ""Medium"" has replaced the older version ""Large."" I was wrong...those are too small, more suited for a small adult. teenager or child. I am disappointed that now I cannot buy another pair of the original Large that was available in early-mid July. I had to give the Large to my husband, and it even gaps a bit on his face! BRING BACK the SMALLER LARGE!

  These masks are too hot. My face was drenched with moisture and sweat when wearing these. They are also too rounded at the nose. They fit size wise but if you have a pointy nose they will push against it and get painful after about 15 minutes of wearing it. The material is like a bra and starts to pill after rubbing on my whiskers.  There is also a large seam that runs down the middle that after the mask gets moist starts to rub on your lips which makes talking very difficult. I do not recommend these masks.

  We recommend these masks for both men and women. We used the ""bridge of nose to chin measurement"" as the product description recommends as our guide and ordered ""large"" size. They fit both a man's larger face and a smaller womens face equally well. The interior of the mask has a soft cotton fabric that is very comfortable. The shape of the mask tapers towards the side of face towards ears and leaves no gaps on side of face which is also beneficial.  Over ear elastic is also comfortable.  We purchased the black since my husband wears it to work.  I have washed them in washing machine and they look as new as when I bought them. Highly recommend.

Three masks for $19.They have great coverage if you BUY THE RIGHT SIZE (duh!) I bought a large and it fits over (2) disposable blue medical-surgical masks. It has enough room to cover my nose and chin almost completely. I'm 5""8.5"", 165 lbs.  with a 17"" neck. I have a goatee. The large fits great. If you need it tighter just tie a knot in one side or both of the ear pieces. That's what I do with those lightweight medical- surgical-type masks.Anyone who can complain about these masks for $19 obviously is not a wise consumer. Go on Vistaprint, and you will see them selling almost identical cotton/fibre masks at (1) mask for $19. That would be (3) masks for $57 if you do the math. This is a great product and I am glad Amazon has it!

  Based on other reviews I ordered a Kids size small. I’m in my late 20’s, petite and 5’3. Most face masks I have bought are way too large for my face. I end up always having to tie the ear loops to make them fit.Upon opening, the masks look tiny and I was at first concerned it would be too small. This mask in the size small fits me perfectly including the ear straps. Thanks to the other reviews for suggesting a children’s size for a petite female. This will definitely make things easier when I have to work long shifts with a mask on. Comfortable, easy to breathe and the ear straps don’t hurt. Definitely would recommend!

  It was all as advertised.  Much easier to wear a face mask that is both comfortable and functional.  Just elastic enough to fit snugly, but not so much it feels like my breathing is restricted.  The sizing chart they use was totally accurate for me.

  My husband is a big guy, 6'4 and everything on him is bigger like his head, face, etc... Every mask he has tried would bother his ears or not cover his face all the way.  I stopped by his work a few weeks back and he was wearing a home-made mask that looked like he was wearing his grandpas depends on his face.  I couldn't stand it anymore.  These masks are AWESOME!  I got him the extra large in black.  They fit perfect and he doesn't look like he has a diaper on his face anymore!  Yay!

  I got these for my 14yo Son upon returning to school as he didn’t want the medical version. These are soft & comfortable for him to wear for an entire school day. It’s a nice material, a little more thicker than another brand I purchased which is nice. The mask is lightweight for him. He says it doesn’t feel heavy on his face & is breathable. The straps stay nicely around his ear with no problem. I got a medium size & it fits him perfectly. 3 masks for what I paid I feel was a bit pricey but was needed at the time. Heads up when washing- they will collect “fuzzies” if washing with other clothes so wash separately or put in a mesh laundry bag. My 4 star reflects too pricey. Recommend the mask though.

  This is the mask I have been looking for. My hat size is 7 and 3/4 to put this in perspective. . . yes extra large. The fabric  that is supposed to go under my chin does and the part that is supposed to cover my nose stays there and does not slip down! The ear loops are comfortable, too and the fabric feels good against my skin. I highly recommend this mask for men (or women) who have had a hard time finding a mask large enough to fit. I am buying more now that I have tried one on!

  The reason I purchased these masks were for an all day outing at Universal Studios, where they are currently requiring all park visitors to wear a mask.  I live in FL, and I knew what to expect with our weather in mid July.  I wanted something comfortable and breathable, hence the reason I chose this product based on review ""Breathable Comfort"". So you might be asking, why three stars?  I was really hoping and leaning into the keyword 'Breathable' here.  And they are no less breathable then any other face mask I've worn.  Definitely not as breathable as the generic hospital masks you get for free when you visit your doctor.  This is the reason for the 3 star review.  It's just not any breathable than any other face mask I've worn. Based on just that, I would have given the product a 1, BUT I didn't because this product does have some other qualities that outshine other masks I've worn.  They do look good when worn compared to other masks. They're very comfortable,  I wore the mask for probably 7 hours straight that day, on hour 6 and 7, my ears wear getting sore, but I stretched out the ears straps a bit, and it was back to comfort.  If I was to give this manufacturer an award, I would award them the 'most fashionable' mask.  I should also  throw in the fact that I HATE masks. Before they were mandated by grocery stores, theme parks, etc, I never wore one.  So if you are those people that have been wearing masks (voluntarily) since the beginning of the pandemic, you might think it's breathable ;)

  These masks are so thin and porous that they are pointless in preventing the spread of Covid. When I got them I immediately realized what a mistake this purchase was. I did two of the tests to see if your mask is effective:1) When you hole them up to a light source can you see through it?2) Can you blow out a flame while wearing it.The results:When you hold them up to light you can see tons of holes. I saw more holes than stars in a country night sky.I was able to blow out a candle while wearing the mask.It scares me to know that thousands of people are wearing these wildly ineffective masks. DON'T BUY THESE SO CALLED MASKS!

  I bought a small size (blue) for our really petit son. The fabric is super soft and snuggly--son's favorite so far. However, the earloop elastic was a bit too long so we had to tie them, which creates little discomfort on the ear. Additionally, the mask does not have a nose band, which allows air inflow. If you are going to use this in low-risk environment, I would recommend it (such as for a quick trip to the grocery store in the early hours), but not for school.

  Its soft, comfortable, fits nicely, covers my entire nose and mouth, its light and breathable.BUT.... It fails the flame test. Like Bill Nye demonstrated on social media (you can look it up), if you can blow out the flame of a lighter through the material of the mask, it WILL NOT guard you, or more aptly guard others, against COVID-19. Plain and simple. These masks are really nice, but should NOT be used during COVID-19 or 2020.

  Before purchasing these masks we took measurements as instructed in the item's photos to help us choose the right size. We are two adults - male and female - and the measurements indicated that we would both require size ""large"". Unfortunately they were way too big for us. Not only were they baggy around the face and very loose around the ear straps, the material stuck to my husband's five o'clock shadow and pulled the mask down beneath his nose every time he opened his mouth to speak. Not good.These masks did seem to be well-made otherwise. Light was not easily visible through them. But if a mask is falling down beneath your nose during a pandemic it's not doing its job. We ended up returning them.

  The ad for this product says that “Masks are not one size fits all”. That is what lured me to try this product. Other masks seemed to barely fit my face and pulled on my ears. This mask fits me and is comfortable. I bought 6 to store in each of my cars as well as have a stock pile at home. My wife tried it on and took 3 away from me for herself. I have now purchased another set to replace the ones she took. I highly recommend them.

  These masks are the best I have seen. They come in the different sizes so they fit your face perfectly. So comfortable you almost forget you have it on. The material is super soft, not too thick and not too thin. It does not have the over the nose pincher to snug it up there, but it fits so well and comes up high enough that I don't feel it is necessary anyway.  I ordered the 3-pack, but if finances allow I am going to order three more. Thank you to whoever designed these and picked out the material.

  I purchased these masks because I wanted something reusable and not wasteful, and specifically wanted XL-sized masks as a bigger fellow. These fit my face perfectly and are both breathable and not overly-hot. Due to the heat where I live, though, I have caught myself sweating in them throughout the day. Another reason it’s good that they’re washable, no need to worry about sweat or germs or anything holding in them.The only real complaint I have is the lack of colors for the XL size. Some of us big dudes like to rep it in purple, after all. If the company does come out with purple, though, I’d 100% buy a 3-pack of those, too!

  Measurements do not take into account trying to talk with these masks; for this and all other non-pleated masks you should add the distance your mouth opens when you talk (about 3/4"" for me) else the mask keeps slipping off your nose or chin.Could use a wire on the nose as well.Overall I find the disposable masks with fabric folds that can expand when you talk much superior to these non-pleated masks.

  After all of the masks I have purchased (and some tossed already) this is the mask we have settled on.  This is the most comfortable light weight, easy to breathe mask I have found and I won't look anywhere else than these masks now.  I have purchased multiple orders of each size.  My kids will only wear the small ones of this brand.  Even the colorful gaiters get pushed aside for these masks.  If there was a downside, I would love more variety of colors.  But overall, this is the mask to beat.  They are like brand new even after washing several times.  Kudos to this mask.  1000 thumbs up.

  We bought two 3-packs, one Large, one Medium, and so far we are VERY PLEASED. N95 masks might be the Holy Grail from a protection standpoint, but try wearing one for more than 30 minutes, especially if you are moving about or if it's hot. In my experience, they become difficult to breathe through and the elastic cuts into you. I don't know how those poor nurses and doctors are suffering through it, but I'm so grateful for them.These masks won't give you the same protection as an N95, but they do seem to provide moderate protection, and YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAND WEARING THESE BECAUSE THE ELASTIC IS STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE MASK IN PLACE, BUT NOT SO TIGHT THAT IT HURTS.With these masks, I can imagine myself wearing one in public for another year if I have to. Though, [ADD SIGH HERE], I hope we don't need to.I've included some photos that show a mask after several machine washes. It's holding up well and we took no extra precautions.Hope this helps someone. Stay safe out there!

  I’m 6’3” and weigh 230lbs. My work requires me to wear a mask for 8-10 hours a day. Most masks are too small, uncomfortable, and stick to my face and nose to the point that I feel like I’m not able to breathe. These masks are a game changer. They are soft while retaining their shape. They don’t pull into my mouth and nose every time I take a breath. They stay on my nose and chin when I talk. What’s more, and very important for long term use, they are extremely comfortable. I hear people complain about masks all the time. When they do, I always recommend these. I ordered another set of three XL because my wife always takes mine. Lol! She loves them too For all the reasons I stated above and she isn’t nearly as big as I am. As long as masks are mandated, I will use these for their comfort, breathe ability, and style. Yes, they look great too. I’ve tried numerous masks, neck gaiters, etc. None of them compare to these masks. I highly recommend them! They are the best masks ever!

What’s more, and very important for long term use, they are extremely comfortable. I hear people complain about masks all the time. When they do, I always recommend these. I ordered another set of three XL because my wife always takes mine. Lol! She loves them too For all the reasons I stated above and she isn’t nearly as big as I am. As long as masks are mandated, I will use these for their comfort, breathe ability, and style. Yes, they look great too. I’ve tried numerous masks, neck gaiters, etc. None of them compare to these masks. I highly recommend them! They are the best masks ever!

  Nice masks. I like that they have different sizes. One size fits all does not fit my tiny head. The medium adult size in these masks fits me great and doesn't slip down throughout the day. They hold up well after several washes. They are relatively easy to breathe in.

  For me, it’s the perfect compromise between wearability and personal protection.  These are three ply but not N95 rated.  That means they are much more comfortable to wear and breath while still providing excellent protection to those around you should you be sick.  They’re about on par with a disposable paper mask when it comes to protecting the user from other people’s germs so keep that social distancing going when around non-mask wearers.

  I think these masks seem very comfortable very lightweight .....I thought they were going to be a little thicker.... I don't know if there's any inner layering for protection.... but I ordered a medium and the small youth size kind of scared me if it was too tight .. my face is not big.. it's not small... I thought the medium would be good..... but definitely a little too loose ....I have to adjust the ear Loops... have to tighten them.  other than that when I tighten the loops I'm sure it'll be fine.... it seems very very comfortable... very very lightweight ....I would imagine it's good for protection ... shopping setting or just being in front of people social distancing... just got them.... I'm washing them and I'm going to adjust loops and try them out!!!

  The face covering part of these is a great fit for my 3, 4, and 6 year old. The problem is the ear loops. They are too big, causing the mask to droop which creates completely inadequate coverage. To fix the issue, I tied the ear loops in a knot, which fixed the coverage issue, but creates discomfort for my children’s ears.I know they make little plastic things you can use to adjust the size of the ear loops, but I didn’t  want to have to purchase something extra. These masks are decently priced, but I ended up purchasing others that are comparably priced and don’t require adjustments or the purchase of ear loop adjusters.The material of these masks is soft and breathable, and if your children are older or have larger faces, they may work.  I would recommend them maybe for older children or suggest that if you want to try these, buy the ear look adjusters as well.

  I've tried several, and these I can wear  a long time, comfortably, and forget about it.  What I particularly like is the asymmetrical cut which stays up over my nose even when I talk without riding up into my eyes.  They are very soft and comfortable.  Added bonus, the middle seam keeps the mask away from my mouth enough that it doesn't get caught in my lips when I talk and of all the masks I own I think these  muffle my voice the least.  I am a teacher, so being able to wear and talk normally is really important.  I find that so many other mask are constantly falling down when I talk, or getting caught up in my mouth that I am constantly having to adjust them back up - not nearly as much with these.  The only draw back is they don't have a wire in the nose bridge, so they do sometimes fog up my glasses (not always).  I wish they would add a nose wire and then these masks would be perfect. - but even without it, these are my favorite by far - I bought them in blue and black.

  I love these masks cause you can breathe easily, through your nose!  I've tried one-use paper masks, cloth masks that fit tightly on your mouth and nose, etc.  And I like this mask the best.  It has a little empty pocket or pouch in the middle of the mask so the cloth is not right up against your mouth and nose, allowing you to breathe easily through your nose.  The tighter fitting cloth masks I was using before these arrived caused me to breathe through my mouth to get enough air, even when I was not exerting myself.  Yeah, I won't be using THOSE masks anymore!

  I held off on buying quality masks because I really didn’t want to allow companies to profit off a pandemic but there’s really no way around it. These fit very well and cover a large part of my face. they’re a mesh like material on the outside and mostly cotton. I don’t have problems breathing unless I’m doing something active like going to the gym.They’re washable but I would probably hand wash them if I were you. They pilled up in a delicate cycle when I put them in the washing machine. And definitely air dry.Measurements are accurate.

  I am a small 5 foot tall woman.  Masks are too big, they are too close to my eyes and too bulky on my face.  I bought this child size mask to correct those problems.  This is a very nice mask, well made, does not shrink in dryer, very soft and breathable.It would fit a large child, it is almost too large for me so I don't think it would fit a small child.  There are two things I would change about the mask.  The mask is the right size from ear to ear but I think it is too wide on the face, it covers my chin which i didn't want but maybe it wouldn't stay on without that, I don't know.  I also wish it had a metal nose piece, it doesn't really need one, fits fine around your nose, I just think its easier to deal with a mask that has one.  Great mask though, glad I bought it.

  I've purchased many masks from many vendors, and by far this is one of my favorites. It's a well made mask of great material. It's extremely comfortable and breathable. The shape of the mask is nice too, and well rounded. There are some masks that are pointy shaped and looks odd on my face. There are only two things I wish was added: a nose wire and possibly longer ear loops and made adjustable. The nose wire is critical on masks since sometimes during conversations the mask can shift. With the nose wire, it will stay in place for the most part. Also, the ear loops are great material, however, I feel in the long run, they may wear down and droop. Something to hold them into their place and offer some type of adjustment would be nice. However, I can't see knocking the rating down because of two minor details can be added to version 2.0

  I am a petite lady and regular masks are too big for my face. These youth/ medium size masks fit just right. They fit more snugly and so are probably more protective. The fabric is nice and soft. I also love that they are washable. I machine wash them in a lingerie bag on the gentle cycle and line dry. They even came in a color that I love, light blue. They are also available in white and black and in size S(children), and L and XL for adults. I would recommend them  to any one who doesn't care for the disposable masks or wants a better fit.

  These masks are very comfortable, fit the mouth/nose area well, and allow for talking without the mask riding down toward the chin.  The  fact that they are sized (see chart) makes for a better fit.  Shaped for your face.  No pulling on your ears due to a small ear loop, as these are sized.  No way to check if material actually has an antimicrobial layer, but it's a plus.If these had an adjustable nosepiece wire, it would assist in decreasing fogging for those who wear glasses, but I've found that masks with such wires only help a little in preventing fogging by decreasing upward air flow on exhalation.  When performing surgery, we used paper tape (very light weight and non-allergenic adhesive) to seal the top of the surgical mask to prevent fogging.

  I ordered a size large. I made sure I measured the bridge of my nose to under my chin to make sure I ordered the correct size. I didn't want to have to return them for the right size as I needed them as soon as they came.Fits great! The ear loops are comfortable and don't pull on my ear or chafe it. The mask covers my face as I hate the masks that are a little too small where the sides only come midway between the side of your cheek to your ear so the strings have to stretch and then there's a gap. If I'm going to be wearing a mask for 8 hours, I want to make sure the lower part of my face is pretty much completely covered and the earloops don't pull.The package comes with 3 masks so I have plenty back ups when I need a clean one. Will purchase again.

There is no metal nose pad, which is fine with me. I got the large because it said ""fits most adults."" They fit well, except I had to tie little knots on the end of the ear loops to shorten slightly; ideally these would have adjustable ear loops, but it wasn't hard to adjust them myself.  I think a medium would've been too small.  I wish there was another color besides black available in the large, but overall this is still my favorite mask if I am going to be wearing it for an extended period of time. I have washed once in the machine and hung to dry. Seemed to work fine.

  Super comfy. 3 layer protection yet thin enough to breathe in. The ear part is a little loose, but with mask clips, it’s perfect. I hate wearing any kind of mask, but since it’s needed nowadays, finding comfortable ones makes it easier to wear one. Easy to clean/wash too. Definitely recommend these.

  This product is true to size and the medium size is perfect for adults with small, narrow faces. It doesn't shift or ride up on the nose and it fits without gaps. I like the blue color for women. I hand washed the masks and they came out well. They are soft. Breathing is generally easy.

  It was really nice to finally find a 3 layered mask (that doesnt need those disposable filters) to protect my 4 year old. Almost all kids masks are just 2 layers of cotton which is zero protection.The shape of the mask fit nicely on his face and stayed on his nose without constantly falling. Soft, light, and breathable.I only gave it 4 stars because the ear loops were the length of my adult masks... could work well for older kids but not 4 years old.Si had to cut off 3.5cm from each ear loop and sow it to attach again. If you know how to needle and thread a few stitches, then this is perfect!

  This mask is OK, but it lacks a moldable, semi-rigid nosepiece. This means that plenty of air enters over the nose. I have a goatee and find that because of the lack of a nosepiece, as I talk, the mask is pulled lower and lower. I would classify this as a comfortable modest safety upgrade from a bandana, best for someone interested in comfort and compliance, but not very worried about protecting themselves.Edit: The seller, Mayfair, went out of their way, both before my review was posted and after to ensure my satisfaction, with no requests or suggestions to alter my review. They simply wanted to be certain I was satisfied.

  Not a huge deal, but the first mask I pulled out straight out of the package had a hole in it, visible from the outside which makes it look like it's old. I normally would try to straighten things out directly with the manufacturer  before leaving a review,  but AZ made it impossible to do so. This was my only venue to say anything? I have not seen the other 2 in this package of 3 as I gave them away to family members and long gone. As for the size and feel of it,  seems to look great and a great fit so far, but I just got it today and was a little disappointed. Seems I've been getting the shaft on everything I buy online anymore and I usually don't complain and just deal with it.

  Good shape, well made, light and comfortable, variety of sizes to choose from.I like that the ear pieces are small and do not 'pull' or feel crammed between the ear and head.  Very comfortable, for a mask (compared to several others I have used).  The shape keeps the mask over the nose, but dips away from eyes and view.  Lightweight, but seems very sturdy.Family agrees with me, so I ordered two more packs.

  I am very happy with these masks. Before the first use I hand washed them and a lot of black dye came off. I was worried that they would fade but they didn't,They're still black. I got the Large ones because I have ""chubby cheeks"" and it nicely wraps around my whole face. I use them at the gym and I can breathe perfectly fine while doing cardio or lifting weights. I highly recommend these masks, and for the price they're hard to beat!

  This face mask really is an extra large size. My husband is a big guy, 6’4”, and it has been impossible to find a mask that wasn’t a one-size-fits-all that actually fit him without his ears looking like he was ready to take off and fly. This mask came in several sizes, and while it was hard to gauge how big an XL might really be, I took a chance and ordered it. Glad I did. If there was a rating for size, I would have given it 5 stars.

When COVID hit, it was a struggle to find a mask that my husband could use and still be able to breathe out of so when I see these I took the gamble and bought them. Great purchase since these are the only ones my husband can tolerate and actually can breathe out of when using these i.e running errands, going to the store etc.Bought some for myself since work has mandated we all use masks for the time being.

  These work well as long as you are not engaged in a conversation with someone.  They are comfortable to wear and do not pull or hurt the ears.  However, everytime I start talking, the mask gets pulled under my nose and I constantly have to readjust ... which means you are constantly touching the outside of the mask with your hands and as someone who works in healthcare that a big NO NO as you are now spreading the germs from the outside of your mask all over the place.  I mostly use these masks when I go to the store or walking through ""common areas"" of places and typically do not engage in many conversations, so for the most part it fits my needs.

With that said, most masks pull on my ears, which is not comfortable at all.  And I have a shaved head, so my ears being pulled forward also bruises my ego when I look in the mirror, because I kinda look and feel like Gollum or Smeagol from The Lord of Rings, which is not a cute look.  I have purchased both black and white EnerPlex XL masks and I love them!  They are comfortable, feel light, and my ears look human again, LOL!  I highly recommend.

  This is one of the most comfortable masks I've gotten (and I've tried many).  What would make it perfect?  If the XL was a bit bigger.  The size different between L and XL is barely noticeable - less than 1/2 inch.  If it came in more colors (like a darker blues/greens/teal/charcoal gray or even purple would be nice.  Have to be very careful about where we put them to keep mine and my husband's apart when they're all black, and I don't like the pale blue or white).  Thinking of bleaching patterns on them to tell them apart, if I can do that w/damaging the fabric.  I'm also thinking of adding a filter pocket...  though not sure how that will affect the comfort.  Adjustable straps and metal nosepiece would be nice, but seems can't get everything I want in one mask.

  I bought the child size (ages 3-9), because adult sized masks have been too large on me. It’s just a bit small and they do work, but I’m going to try the Medium. In the gym, I’ve tried wearing the paper disposable masks, 100% synthetic material masks, 100% cotton masks, and these masks. Although I haven’t found a mask to be totally comfortable while working out, the Enerplex mask was the most comfortable and breathable. I was really sweating under the other masks. These kept my face more dry. So, for me, these have worked the best in the gym. The other masks will be relegated to wearing during shopping and at work (when we go back).

  I have bought a lot of masks since this thing started, but getting ready to go back to work I wanted something that I could wear all day and covered all the parts of my face.  This mask does both - it's 3 layers goes high on the nose and wraps under chin, ear loops did not hurt after 10 hours at work.  Best mask I've had that meets all my needs.  Note - I have a huge head (hats don't fit) and a full face, so I ordered XL - they were way to big for my face and didn't feel protective with gaps and movement.  The customer service of this company is FANTASTIC - would want to add an extra star for that alone.  They proactively reached out to me to make sure they worked, I let them know they were too big, and they quickly helped me get the right size.  The large fits wonderfully for me.  I feel like these masks are good for essential/customer service workers.

They proactively reached out to me to make sure they worked, I let them know they were too big, and they quickly helped me get the right size.  The large fits wonderfully for me.  I feel like these masks are good for essential/customer service workers.

  Finally, a mask that fits! My third purchase of supposedly ""XL"" reusable face masks; none of the previous were even close to as big as the awful blue disposable ones.These Enerplex are easy to breath through, soft and comfortable, and have enough structure that they don't deflate and itch, or mess up my mustache. The ear elastic is snug enough and doesn't pull or pinch. And I don't look or feel like I'm wearing a child's mask.I didn't give them five stars because there's no formable nosepiece, thus the mask gaps under the eyes and also a little between the ear loops

  I have had a hard time finding masks for my 8 year old. Kid's sizes are usually too small, adults too large so I was so happy when my daughter told me these masks fit her perfectly. She can breathe comfortably with them on and is able to go through the school day with no problems. They are reusable and so far, have done well going through the washer and dryer (To make them last longer, I do think I will start handwashing them).Surprisingly, they also fit my 12 year old comfortably so I ended up buying another set of 3.Well worth the money and I may even make a third purchase in the near future!

  Picked these up due to new work regulations regarding plain colored masks. I love them! I plan on purchasing more. As you can see in the picture, I wear glasses. My glasses will only fog up if I’m in a cold environment or if I’m breathing heavily (usually after bounding up several flights of stairs). Other than that, I hardly notice it’s on my face. It’s comfortable, breathable, and I’ve even worn it upside down on occasions to see which way I like best. As long as I position it right when I first put it on, it won’t suck into my face when I’m talking. Also, they wash well. Haven’t quite seen any wear from the washing machine.

  These masks fit, but tug on the ears and make them stick out a little. Granted I have a huge head, size 8 hat, so they will be fine for normal heads. The outside of the mask is cotton, the inside is polyester or something similar to nice basketball shorts. Very thick, which is probably good for protection but do restrict breathing a bit, and they are pretty hot.That all said, they are stylish, and very high quality.

  I do not like cloth masks and have been using the medical kind but I can't stand it when they get ""fluffy"" on the inside.  My son has been using these black ones for a few weeks and loves them so I thought I should give them a go too.  I love these masks as they are soft and light and most importantly you can wash them!  The large were way to large for me, even though I measured as directed.  When I informed the seller, they immediately shipped a small size to me at no cost even though I had opened and washed the large ones.  Very happy with them and highly recommend.

  I have several kinds of masks, but these are the ones I pull out if I'm going to be around a group of people. With the outer covering to help keep moisture partials out and two more layers for added protection makes it a little heaver, but with regular wear you get used to it. It is well made with solid seams and stretchable ear pieces. If adjusted to your face it will lay flat keeping bad air out.

  Looks fine and is soft, BUT anytime I have to wear these more than a few minutes, the tiny elastic bands cut into the area behind my ears.  This was very pronounced when I had to wear it 6+ hours during air travel recently.  Also, it's very tight to the face and what air does get out, goes straight up into my glasses fogging them up, so just not practical to wear this all day.

  I bought a 3-pack of large size masks to help protect against the Corona virus.  The first thing I did when I tried them on was the lighter test because they felt very thin (even though they’re 3 layers).  It failed the test miserably.  The flame went out without much force at all.  Almost as if I wasn’t wearing anything.  I was very disappointed because there was a question about the lighter test and the person who answered said it passed the test (the flame stayed lit), but it doesn’t.  The fact that it failed means there’s too much airflow through the mask.  These masks will do little, if anything, to protect you from the virus. The fit was fine although there were gaps around the nose as there is no nose bridge, which I knew when I bought them.  I’m sure these work fine for protecting from dust particles, but that wasn’t my intention. I wouldn’t purchase these for any medical purpose.

  I consider myself average size, weight etc.  Thinking these might run a little small, I ordered an XL.  Ok, still too small and non elastic ear straps .  In addition, no nose wire and as a result, putting one on,  I could feel air coming in around the top of my nose. I would also assume, as a result,  they would fog glasses?  Sooo, how good of a job would it do?  I sent them back.

  I liked that they were black and the material was very soft.  However, these masks make breathing very difficult and cause the face to sweat. I've worn them multiple times to go grocery shopping since receiving and couldn't understand why my simple grocery runs were becoming so unbearable.  At one trip I swapped the mask for a different one and immediately experienced relief. I am sad to be out the money for these since they are unusable for my family. You might like them, but my husband, kids and I didn't. We each had similar experiences while using at different times.

  Every since the face mask order began, I felt like Goldilocks trying to find the mask that ‘fits just right’. I have to say that these masks can finally put my ‘Goldilocks experience’ to an end. These masks are stylish, breathable, and comfortable. Do not get this if you plan on wearing glasses, as it will fog them up (you can’t have your cake and eat it too). Just go with contacts if you can. Though, these masks will make up for anyone who are used to wearing stylish prescription glasses (like I do), as these masks will make you look great with or without them.Also, I Initially got a “large” and I found it to be a little looser and slightly bigger for my face. The medium, I would describe as a more “tailored fit” if you will, for my face. If this is a preference for someone. I like that these masks are not a cloth-like material. The front of mask feels like a soft meshy fabric (which is the polyester) and inside is cottony and breathable. Overall, this mask doesn’t make me feel like I want to rip it off after 10mins of wearing it.

  In today's society wearing a face mask is a must.  I got these three masks for under $20.00, which is pretty cool all by itself, seeing that there are a lot of companies out there selling just 1 for the same price.  While there is nothing fancy about these masks,  they are comfortable and easy to breathe through.  Would recommend to others.

  I initially bought the XL face masks for my husband because he has a big head and has a beard.  He loved them from the first moment he tried them on.  He said they are very comfortable and fit him perfectly.  I had ordered more for myself and my children in the other colors and sizes.  These are the most comfortable face masks I have worn. I feel like I can breath fine, the loops don't bother my ears at all, and it feels so soft on my face. I had other face masks that I couldn't wear for very long because I felt suffocated and the elastic loops pulled on my ears. I also had other face masks for my children that they found to be uncomfortable.  But my kids also love them. I plan on ordering some more.  I would highly recommend these masks to anyone.

I have a drawer full of masks that are either to small for my big head or hard to breath in for any period of time.  Plus these face masks are very soft and comfortable on the skin and around the ears.  I am looking forward to ordering more of them to keep them handy in all my vehicles and around the house and work.Don't hesitate to order these face masks because you will not be sorry for getting them!

  Great mask! I'm a big guy, 6'4"" 340 lbs, have a large face. Ordered the XL size, it was perfect! Comfortable, breathing is easy.

  I like the mask, the material fells good and it’s not that hard to breathe out of.... my main issue is that the mask could be a little bigger to fit my face. So maybe a XXL would be perfect.I’m 6’5 and 300 lbs. and when I wear the mask, the top portion of the mask sits right in the middle of the bridge of my nose which makes it uncomfortable for me and hard to talk without constantly having to readjust the mask. Also the straps that loops behind the ears pulls kind of hard on the cartilage on the back of my ears.So I believe increasing the size offered for this mask would correct this.

  Mask shape and material is the best we've found so far. Washes fine (we put in dishwasher or in a laundry bag in washer, then hang dry in sun or a warm spot).  Very comfortable. If I'm in the car or walking early when no one is around, I wear it on my wrist, the loops fit over it easily, then can quickly put it on as needed.

  I'm back to make my second purchase of these masks. I bought my first about 2 months ago and have been satisfied.  I use these masks mostly when I am out and about in my neighborhood and walking or exercising. They are not as thick, so they are comfortable and breathable to me when doing low or moderate-intensity activities. I also put these in the washer (and dryer) after each use, and they are holding up well. If I go to a more higher-risk environment where I may have to be in closer proximity with people, I use my other masks with triple layer protection and room for a filter - but these are fine for low-risk/contact activities.

  I bought these xl masks for my husband, but I wear them too. I really like them. Nice look. Very soft. Comfortable. Good fit. Very well-made, no damage and no shrinkage after repeated machine washing and drying.I didn't pick the size for myself, so they are a little big on me, but not so much as to be a problem. The price was more than I wanted to spend on masks, but I'm still very happy with the purchase and would definitely buy these again if I need more masks.

  I love this set of masks. I ordered a large, but I think a medium would have sufficed. It’s breathable, but still passes the lit flame test.

These masks are well made and very durable. I will be purchasing more.

  These are perfect. My nephew has a big face, apparently, other cloth masks slip up over his chin when he talks. He asked for larger ones with a nose wire so his glasses don't fog, I forgot the nose-wire requestg but these fit him so well he's keeping them and doesn't want me to keep looking. They look really good on him, very smooth on his face but he can talk and breathe without the cloth moving.  He's a very choosy teenager; this kind of approval from him is rare. Glad I bought them.

  I bought the XL and it is incredibly comfortable and breathing is easy. The only reason for three stars instead of five is that there is no wire across the nose bridge. It doesn’t make for a secure fit and if you wear glasses, the lack of a secure fit means your exhalation causes your glasses to fog up.

  I find these masks to be more comfortable than other masks I've tried. Since they're structured, I feel like I actually have some room to breathe and talk inside of the mask. I just wish they had a metal thingy on the nose area to be able to tighten it there a bit to avoid fogging my glasses. But, even without that nose piece, I find my glasses fog less with these masks compared to others without a nose piece. I'm a petite woman and the medium fits me well.

  Very happy with the quality and fit(i got larges).  I strongly suggest following the instructions and washing them first.  Not sure what was on them but they were almost waterproof prior to washing, might have just been a combination of tight threads and machine dust.  Regardless wash them and they become much more breathable/comfortable. I sun dried mine, so can't speak to if they will shrink in a dryer.  I found the fit perfect out of the box, so didn't want to risk it.

  These masks are fantastic and make wearing a face mask much less awful than anything else I had tried before. They’re not too tight on the ears (assuming you buy the right size) so you can wear them for most of a good full work day before “ear fatigue” sets in. They’re heavier material so you rarely suck the material in when you’re active and take a deeper breath (stairs lol), but they still feel light on the face and quite cool. Unfortunately all masks are warm but this is the “least warm” I’ve tried and won’t stick to your face if you sweat.

He doesn't even mind that the mask doesn't have adjustable ear pieces.  The elastic that is used instead is very comfortable and the mask is very soft.  It also doesn't have the formable nose clip, but he says it doesn't make a difference.  When he wears these out, I will buy him more.  Give these a try if you have a beard or a larger head.

  Well made, arrived quickly, soft material, elastic ear straps make fitting easy.  My face is 4.5"", between a youth and a large.  Unfortunately neither size fit.  Large fell off my face, youth just barely fit, and if I moved my mouth much to talk, it fell off my nose, and it's constantly moving up and down my nose, which I find annoying.  My husband has a large and loves it - says it's much better for exercising in than his disposable mask and cotton mask.  However, when I stretch the material as it would fit on my face, I can see light through it.

  In my family, we each own about a dozen reusable face masks.  These are by far the most comfortable with a great fit and considerable protection.  I own some masks that are extremely uncomfortable or hard to breathe in.  Others are comfortable but don't provide the same level of protection.  This is a well-rounded mask.  The large fit by 9 and 13-year-old boys.  The XL fits me and my wife.

Will see how it looks after a wash. If deteriorates after wash, I'll write an update of this review!For sure it will not protect you from viruses specially if you are very close to an infected person. But it does keep you relatively safe in your ordinary daily life outside the house (while keeping social distance, avoid touching your eyes/nose/mouth etc etc).

  These are very soft to the touch and comfortable.  They give great coverage over the nose and mouth and they don't slide up when talking like other masks I've tried.  I am on the phone all day with my job, so I needed a comfortable mask that stays put.  I also wear glasses, and these masks come up high enough so that I can place my glasses on top of it so they don't fog up on me. They also wash up well in the washer and dryer.  I would definitely recommend these.

  When I got these, I tried them on and was so pleased.  Feels soft and doesn't slide up into my eyes.  I'm an adult with a somewhat chubby face and the size large fits perfectly, as there is enough stretch.  The company says they must be washed before wearing, and it's true.  The chemical smell was strong, so I hand washed with mild soap.  It helped some, but not enough, so I ended up just tossing them in with my next load of laundry (but no dryer).  All fine now.

  Ordered these because they said they were light weight. While they’re super comfortable on your face, they are not easily breathable. I have to wear a mask for most of my workday with safety glasses on my face as well. They’re better than many of my masks as far as not fogging up my safety glasses but my face is unbelievably sweaty with them on. Don’t buy if you have to wear a mask all day long, not bad for just a quick trip into the grocery store though.

  I ordered these to throw in the car for when I forget to grab my regulars and these are by far better than the disposables but after 15 min of wearing this, you are ready for a break. The material is just to thick to wear for very long. I was happy about the size, it covers the areas most masks don't. I wasn't constantly pulling the mask up over my nose. The ear elastic was comfortable too, just needs a thinner material for breathing.

  I wasn't sure about the fit at first because although they were big enough for me when I talked they seemed to slide down a bit.  After a couple washings they seemed to fit better and I got used to them.  Now they are the only mask I use.  So far I have washed them about 5 times and they hold up very well.  I like that they have a non-woven outer layer, soft inner layers and are good quality.  I do wish they had a nose wire though but other than that I'm happy.

  Update: The company reached out to me & sent me a new pack at no cost. They fit absolutely perfectly. And I was able to tie loops on the ear bands with the old pack so that they fit better as well. Very happy. These masks are super light and easy to breathe.I purchased these for my 8 year old son. They were the perfect fit, or so we thought. They are way way too big. The ear loops are too long and the mask falls off of him almost immediately. Seems like they are a good mask overall, but unfortunately way too big. I ordered the small size

  My son is not impressed with the mandated mask order for returning back to school. I brought several others and he refused to wear them. These came right before school started and he actually found them acceptable. My teen son wore these for his first days at high school. My only problem with this product is they are my sons favorite masks to wear and he has already lost the first two masks and is down to the final one. I wish there was a way to make sure he didn't lose them!

  These masks are quite comfortable.  I can tell they are a bit thicker than a typical disposable mask.  They are soft but not super soft, but it's fine because after awhile I forget it's even on my face.  The strings that go behind your ears are nicely made and have a small amount of stretch to them.  They are soft and do not rub on my ears.  I like how it  contours around my nose to get a better seal.For the money these are great masks!

  I have purchased several different types of masks and none fit as well as this product.  Most don't have size options so I was anxious to see how they fit.  I followed the instructions as posted and purchased the large size and the fit is a great fit.  Not big and loose where there are gaps between mask and face and large enough to cover my mouth and nose.  Very good fit overall and easy to breathe with 3 ply.  Will buy more for other family members.  Highly recommend.  The only suggestion I have is if they there was a pocket sewn on the inside to hold a filter that would be absolutely perfect.

  I've tried so many masks and this is the first mask that fits my face and doesn't hurt my ears or push on my nose. Every other mask pulls against my nose too much, pulls against my ears too much, or is just so undersized that it looks weird.I'm 6'3"" 250lbs and this fits really well. Its a tiny bit bigger than I need, so if you're a little bigger this will still work, but for my size or a little smaller the XL size will work just fine and be very comfortable

  I bought these for an 8 yr old to wear, an 8 yr old that is very picky about how fabrics fit and feel against his skin (don't get me started on the seam in socks!). These masks fit perfectly, the loops are stretchy so the child is able to put on and take off with no help AND the fabric is soft, smooth, plus breathable. These are also breathable and the teacher is able to hear the 8 yr old while the mask is on. Plus, because the fit is so perfect, one can actually tell when the child is smiling, confused, angry or sad. The facial communication is not lost as the mask is not too big.Price point is GREAT, Shipping was SUPER FAST. Ordering more right this minute.

  Initially these masks seemed ok.  Acceptable for a 10 minute jump inside a store to pick up a few things.  But when I wear them longer they quickly ride up into my eyes.  The masks don't stay in place when you look down, and eventually they ride up high enough on my face to cover my eyes.  Grocery shopping is an experience of constantly pulling the mask down my face to a more comfortable position so the mask top edge doesn't touch my eyeballs.  I'll have to shop for replacements.

  These masks were recommended to me as not smashing the face as other masks tend to to. I wore this mask while on a Costco shopping trip yesterday and holy wow they’re SO comfortable! I was wearing lip floss and the front of the mask did not touch my mouth. I could breathe and the mask did not feel like it was smashing my nose either. I ordered these in XL fyi. I believe that’s why they work so well. I could shop for hours in comfort with these masks.

  I liked the shape and style of these masks. The material is somewhat soft and comfy enough against my face for all day use. I am a bit hesitant on the type of protection these masks offer due to the material being slightly see through when I held a flash light to it.  I ordered an adult large which seems to be the standard size but it's a bit loose on me.  Especially when I speak for a long period of time, the mask seems to slide down my nose a bit.  Would be a big plus if these masks had a nose clamp and we're a bit more fitted.

  I bought these to have a breathable face mask with more polyester or spandex material than cotton. When I received them, they seemed like they were quality masks. However, there is no metal nose clip so there are gaps around the material on the bridge of my nose. I don't like having the air I'm exhaling going into my eyes as it's irritating, so these masks didn't work for me. Aside from the absent nose clip, they seemed like quality masks.

  After doing a lot of research trying to find the best basic mask, this one seemed to be the best choice based on price and reviews. My biggest concern was whether to get the medium or large based on the sizing chart provided on the website, along with the other comments on sizing.  I am in between a large and a medium. My measurement is slightly less than 5 inches. I went with the medium.  After receiving my masks in the mail, the medium was definitely the right size. It is a perfect fit. It was snug around the nose, cheeks, and chin without being too short or having open gaps. I was also worried about there not being any type of security wire around the nose, but that is not an issue at all based on how the mask is designed. The straps around the ears do not pull and sit very comfortably. There were also comments about the mask being thin like a tee-shirt, but definitely not the case. To me, they are the perfect thickness. Any thinner and I would feel like they’re not doing any good. Any thicker, and it would be a little difficult to breathe comfortably. These are constructed just right. I’ll be ordering another set of mediums tonight without any hesitation. I hope this helps.

The XL are definitely for people with large faces or men with beards.  I knotted the XL around my ears and the ear loops are still comfortable. The L will fit a female or male face as well. These are great masks and I appreciate the different sizes. I will definitely stock up because I wasted plenty of money on other masks that were ill-fitting. I love these masks!!!!

  These masks are soft & stretchy, but they are extremely uncomfortable if you have to wear them for longer than 5 minutes.  It's difficult to breathe with them on and I became dizzy, lightheaded & nauseous whilst grocery shopping because I was breathing & re-breathing the same air.  Unfortunately, I ordered 2 packs and won't be opening/using the 2nd because they're that unpleasant to use.  (Can't return it, either, because I would have to return both, but can't return one of the packages because I opened it)

  These fit! I bought extra large because the span across my face, ear to ear, is over 6"" and I couldn't find a mask that didn't pull at my ears. Not only do the fit me, they fit my husband too. Another thing that I was looking for is a mask that would go across my nose area and still reach below my chin. I have a fat face and double chin but this fits without pulling down or up when I talk. There are smaller sizes but this XL is a great fit for me. The inner fabric is a soft jersey and the litter is a stretchy, soft nylon fabric. Very comfy and more breathable than others I have tried.

  These masks came to me as described , they were very comfortable and stretched really well I could breath well while on my face. the material was very soft. I followed the direction and washed as directed and laid out to dry. I had a slight issue because of my personal facial features and they worked with me. Thank you! If this plandemic continues and I need to purchase more for me and my family I would not hesitate to buy more of these.

  The face masks I make don't allow for much air to be blown through.  These, you can blow a candle out when blowing through them.  They are soft and comfy-, the ear loops are fairly cheap.  One of them was already falling apart.  That being said, they are soft and stretchy.

  I ordered a large and it was the perfect size for my face… I feel like if I would’ve ordered a medium it may have been just a bit too small or tight and I would rather have it be a little loose anyway… Very soft and breathable have not washed it yet but I will this evening and if anything changes I will update this review but so far so good. Best part is the straps are very comfortable and don’t hurt the back of my ears and the mask sits on my nose so that my glasses do not fog up while wearing

  These masks were perfect for my husband.  I decided to spend a little more since he is picky with masks and I am glad I did.  I bought my husband a size Large, he is 170lbs, 5'11''.  They are not snug but cover everything and protect him fine.  He doesn't mind wearing them and likes that they are plain black.  I have been wearing decorative cloth ones but am tempted to buy these because they are comfortable, easy to breathe in and look nice.

  I wear these during my 8hr shift and they really are a good quality. Before wash, it will feel a little too big, but just put it in the wash like it says and it fits perfect after! I like that it forms to your face well, and it doesn't get a lumpy or wrinkled from the washer/dryer. It functions properly, I wasn't able to blow out a candle with it on, but I am still able to breathe well with it on. Quick delivery. Only down side is if you wear glasses you may need to reposition slightly to prevent fogging, and the ear loops might get a little irritating if you have to wear it through an entire shift like I do, but that might just be because of my glasses or ears.

  Much more comfortable than the ones I'd sewn from T-shirts.My daughter's head is larger than mine (seriously, LOL). The masks and elastic around the ears fit us both comfortably with no gaps. It fits well around and under the chin on both of us too. I hand washed the night I received them and they dried by morning. Have since machine washed in a lingerie bag in the wash and line dried. They're holding up well.

I live in Atlanta, so I can't be mad considering the temps here.I bought another pack of these to keep around the house as spares for myself and partner. They wash well, the curvature of the cheek area fits correctly, and there are no huge gaps.

  We've ordered many varieties of masks over the last few months due to Covid-19, and of all of them, these are definitely the most comfortable to wear and the easiest to breathe through.  As far as critiques go...I do wish they had a nose wire, as they do not create a very good seal on the top of the mask.  And be warned that they are quite large, so my wife for example, has no hope of wearing this brand.

  I love these masks. I ordered XL for my husband who is 6ft and they fit him well. He said they are very comfortable . I ordered a large for myself I am 5'4"" and was on the border between med & large on the chart so I ordered up according to the directions.  When I got the large, they were slightly too big so I washed and dried them and they shrank very little but enough to make a difference. They wash up well but don't  dry them if you don't  want them to shrink. I highly recommend  them.

We soon learned that since he has to think about hat size, he also has to think about mask size. These are great. They fit well, they are light weight and summer wearable. I look like a little kid playing dress up in them, but they really do fit him perfectly.

  This mask is super soft and comfy. Works best when I pull the top part high on the bridge of my nose and place my glasses on the mask instead of above -- less fogging. Straps are strong but thin which is great because it leaves plenty of room for my glasses earpiece and my hair. I place them in a garment bag to wash in the washing machine and then air dry. They hold up. I'm very satisfied, will probably order some more.

  I have just received my masks. I hand washed and air dried them. I was wondering about the fit as one reviewer said that the recommended size did not work for her son and husband. I used the size guide on the product’s Amazon site. I am 6'-1"" and did the measurement and the large mask fit comfortably and completely. I tried the flame test and was not able to blow out a match or even ripple the flame. One thing I would mention is that the masks do not have a nose wire. It can be an issue for me because I wear glasses. I had looked at a lot of the products on Amazon and so when I ordered I forgot to double check this feature on these masks. It’s my own fault. None the less I am very happy with the quality and comfort of the masks and would recommend them.

I run very hot, so I basically breathe out heat all day and that causes me to overheat easily and get very sweaty but these definitely helped that issue.

  I really like the quality of these ones by far the best face masks I have received. They are soft, lightweight, and good on the sizing. The only downside for me personally was the big gap for the nose. I do understand that the maker is taking into account the various face shapes, and my nose is on the smaller and flatter side so it requires some occasional adjusting while walking around, but that's it really. Definitely would purchase more of these again.

  I bought these for my son to wear in school. Overall, these masks are good. They are super comfortable and easy to breathe and speak through. They also don't allow any light to pass through when holding the mask up to a light, which is what a good clothe mask is supposed to do. The only thing it's missing is an adjustable nose piece so there is a small gap by the nose area. I will probably add my own.

  Great masks! Wonderful breathability and I love that it comes with three. I leave one in my wallet so I have have it on me, I leave one at the house for quick access and I leave one in my car for my Krav class that I don’t mind sweating in. The curved stitching under the eyes keeps it from getting too high on my face, so they’re incredibly comfortable and I never need to adjust or pull down.

  These are my favorite masks! I originally bought them for my 7 and 12 year old kids. My 7 year old is picky and won’t wear them, my 12 year old wears them, but the most pleasant surprise has been my love for them. I am a petite adult and they fit my face great! They are comfortable (don’t full on my ears or fall down when I talk) and I can actually breath in them. I have bought a total of 3 packages and recommended them to several friends! My favorite mask- BY FAR!

  Probably not much protection due to looser fit and no pocket for insertable filter, but this is a mask my family and I will wear because it is comfortable and the XL size fits our slightly larger faces.  Lightweight fabric is very stretchy, as are the ear loops.  It would be much better if ear loops were adjustable.  Also, there is no wire above the nose to make it fit tighter under glasses, but I bought some separate wire strips that can be stuck on.  A mask only works is you can stand to wear it, and these provide at least some protection for folks who can't tolerate tighter and thicker masks.  We have others to wear when we need better protection.

  I am so pleased! I bought a bulk pack of another brand and it barely had any coverage and completely came off my nose if I opened my mouth too wide.  This is snug, fitted, covers my nose and goes way past my chin. Doesn’t budge when I talk or yawn and is super breathable. I could not be happier. I also have glasses, and it does fog a bit but because of the dip at the cheekbones it’s not as bad.

  I ordered these mask in XL and after receiving them washed them right away to use the next day. Every mask I’ve tried so far was too small for my face so I assumed XL would fit me perfectly. I was wrong, after using it I realized the masks were ineffective since they were too big for me and let in too much air from the sides. The seller emailed me making sure I was satisfied with the product and I emailed back asking if I could get large mask, right away they sent me the best fitting masks I’ve had and didn’t ask for anything in return (not even a review). I definitely recommend these masks, not only for how great they are but also for the company actually caring about their customers.

  These are a dream!  I returned to Orange Theory for workouts after six months...the mask I wore at first left me gasping for air and panicked!  These masks are perfect for working out, covering mouth and nose well and room so I'm not sucking mask when I breathe.  My only complaint is that after an hour, the straps started to feel uncomfortable behind my ears, but a small price to pay to be able to work out and breathe at the same time.  So glad to have found these!

  Materials are good.  Fits well.  Covers both nose and mouth adequately.  Initially, one may have trouble breathing normally since this mask is fabric and the disposable ones are much easier to breath in.  After a few minutes, you will get used to the breathing.  Washing is no problem.  Treat it like the delicates.  Low temperature on the dryer.  The heat will disinfect the fabric.  One critique I have is the lack of color and design choices.  More color and design choices should be made.  You'll get more sales!  But maintain the materials integrity.

Sleek design, soft but keeps its shape, strings don’t hurt your ears, medium can fit probably anyone 100lbs-200lbs. Does a good job of protecting you.

He is a big guy with a larger than avg head and all the face masks with the exception of the motorcycle neck type are never big or comfortable enough for him. These are awesome! Soft and super comfy. I have him 2 and kept one for me because even I like it a lot. Because it’s big it gives me extra breathing room and does not hurt my ears but doesn’t fall off either. Highly recommend

It passed the flame test (try to blow out a flame holding it at a safe distance, if the flame doesn't move you have good filtration especially at 6ft feet from others). I also purchased peel & stick nose strips from another company for extra reinforcement around the nose but we'll probably only need those for very windy days, we're in FL.

  Took me forever to find and decided on good face masks. These are great. The xl actually fits a big face with a beard. They’re soft and hand wash and dry really easily. They also don’t mess with or bother my nose piercing. The ear straps pull a tad bit but you barely notice after a few seconds. The band will stretch a bit anyways so it doesn’t matter

  WOW. I am surprised. Sooper soft. WAY better than what I expected. The nose area is contoured. Perfect fit. I'm having them embroidered with my school's logo by a local guy. Thrilled with the cost and the comfort. Spot on. Thanks.

  I'd prefer to buy locally but apparently my face is too small for most masks. And obviously you can't try them on ahead of time so... yay this actually fits (medium)! Could be a bit thicker but it conforms perfectly to my face and I believe that's what matters most. Buying for a third time so I have enough to wash between each use.

My husband is a tall and big guy and these XL are a great fit for him.  I like them, too, because they don't mash my face and I have some space inside the mask in which to breathe.

  I've bought masks from 5 different sellers since COVID hit, in addition to making several of my own, and these are by far the most comfortable and best fitting of all of them for both me and my boyfriend.  They are soft and never get itchy even when having to wear them for extended periods or when exerting myself (such as walking up several flights of stairs at work).  They were a little big for my face, so I just tied a knot in ear ear loop and the are perfect now.  They also stay in place very well when talking- they don't ride up the chin or 'suck in' to my mouth.  Love these... I ended up buying 3 more sets so we both have enough to get through the work week with one extra.  Definitely recommend!

  These are very soft and ""Comfortable"" based on softness alone but they are almost too soft.  As a result, they tend to cling to your face to the point that it does not allow any gaps or air to flow in and around your mouth and nose..  I like the soft feel but there needs to be some sort of stiffer shell to keep it from clinging to my mouth.  I can't wear them as a result and obviously cannot return now.

  These are great. I live in a mask at work, and these are super comfy. I got a large and it fits my face and my fiancé’s face perfectly. Been using these masks for about a month or so, and they are not coming apart or fraying at all. They also smell like my detergent that I wash them with! They’re also incredibly breathable if you are just wearing the one mask. The only downside is that my face gets sweaty after wearing it for a while or when it’s hot (I live in AZ, so it’s always hot lol), but that can’t really be avoided with any masks. Overall, great product!

  I have a big face and a hard time breathing through masks, was hoping these would help with all the positive reviews, but it was a complete bust. These masks are made of synthetic materials and are very thick, making them very difficult to breathe through. They also aren't much bigger than regular size masks. Completely useless.

  I've really had a hard time finding masks that fit me and my kids without falling to our chins. One size does not fit all. My husband has a full beard so what fits him ends up being a chin diaper on us. I loved that I can order them in different sizes. We ordered mediums and they fit my 11 year old perfectly. The material is very soft and more breathable than the cotton.  It's thick enough that I think it's still effective. I can wear it while staying active without sweating from the mask. A mask is only effective if you can keep it on. The ear loops are elastic so they hold the mask close even with smaller faces. And the price is right!! I'll be ordering more so we can have spares in our cars and at work.

  The mask's material seems durable and is comfortable/light enough to wear for extended periods of time. However, there is no malleable piece of metal near the nose to provide a secure fit and the large sizing leaves the mask loose on my face (it wont fit my wife's face at all). The ear straps are not adjustable, either. My wife purchased a different 3-mask set from American Eagle for significantly less money and each mask is adjustable, providing a snug fit around the nose. These masks will only work for those who need larger sizes; I'm 6'1"" and incorrectly assumed the large sizing would be fine for me. I'd recommend finding masks that are adjustable and more form fitting.

  So far among the 5 different types of masks I have used, this one stands out as the best and most comfortable that I have found. While I cannot attest to the filtering efficiency of the mask, this is the only one that would be acceptable in an outdoor environment during the summer. It is soft, breathable, light weight and durable and makes wearing much less of a pain. I can see why it is a top choice and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mask.

  The pamphlet in the packaging says it is made of a 100% polyester outer layer, 65% polyester/35% cotton middle, and 65% polyester/35 % cotton with ""agion"" antimicrobial agent inner layer.Googling agion, it seems to be some type of silver and copper particle formulation that has antimicrobial properties. Not to concerned with that, just happy to have a mask that has a water repellent outer layer, and a more absorbant inner layer that is easily breathable, fits well to my face, and is comfortable.I ordered the large size and I think i have a fairly typical sized adult male face, maybe a little on the small side if anything, and the mask fits pretty well. Maybe could be just a tiny bit bigger, so if you think you have a large face, xl would probably be best.

  Nice mask...except for one critical thing.  There's no bendable strip at the top to make the top of the mask fit snugly across the cheeks and nose bridge.  As a result, there's a gap which allows your breath to escape and air to be inhaled.  It defeats the purpose of COVID protection and, thus, is a waste of money.

Then there is the problem with the earbands. There too tight and not made out of soft material. Kinda like a rough hair tie. These would have been good if earbands were adjustable or loose and made out of soft material. I thought about maybe if I went xl size might not be as tight. But still not happy with the earbands how there made hurts back of my ears. Going in the trash as I will find better ones.

  I purchased the smallest size of this mask for my kids ages 4 to 12.  The bands that go aroudn the ears barely fit tight enough around my 12 year old.  My other kids cannot wear these as they do not stay on.  The cloth is nice, and they seem decent in quality, but the size is compeltely inaccurate due to the ear bands.

  Hands down the nicest mask I’ve found. Comfortable and not made of cheap materials. This isn’t your typical homemade mask people sell made from old t shirts. This is a nice polyester outer layer and soft inner layer. Breaths very nicely and doesn’t touch your lips when you talk. I’m going to order another 3 pack so I have spares.

  I measured my kids' faces and went with medium which says youth/adult small. It is way too big for both. The larger kid is 5'1"" and 105 lbs and it gapes hugely at the nose. The smaller kid whose measurements still led me to buy these, it falls right off the nose. The biggest issue  appears to be the ear loops which feel flipsy and elastic but without any tension there. I guess they fit me, a grown (large) woman ok. I will say they feel very comfortable but I am not sure I have full confidence it won't fall down - it has a looseness and I don't like the loose fit around the nose (again, on me)

  I’ve ordered a bazillion masks trying to find a type that fit my 10 year old daughter properly AND she likes to wear.  These masks have been the absolute best!  They fit perfectly, are really soft, and have enough layers to be safe. I also ordered a larger size in black for my son and those were winners too.  In both instances the ear loops were a tad long, but I tied little knots in them and they are perfect.  I definitely recommend these!

I am clean-shaven but he has a beard.The masks are made from a soft, flexible, and breathable material and are the right size for the average adult male as they fit both of us.  They also hold their shape well after washing with soap and water.My father-in-law was happy that they these masks soft and flexible and fit well around his beard without leaving any gaps.  I will definitely consider buying these again when these wear out over time from from having to wash each time to ensure they remain sterile.

  Great for men with beards. I purchase this for my hubby and he loves it. The blue standard masks would rise up with his beard or would snap off my the ears. This is a great alternative: The only negative thing I have to say is that it flaps in / moves as you inhale and exhale and when you hand wash it the dye bleeds a lot.

  I really liked how this mask didn't hurt my ears (finally!!). It stays in place pretty well, and bc the cloth extends over more of your face, the elastic straps don't tug on my ears.It's also super soft. This is the first mask I've worn that I forgot I was wearing. (I've tried at least five before this one.) I also wear glasses, they do fog up slightly the first couple hours, but after that I haven't noticed any fogging. (Maybe I don't wear it properly, and eventually the mask adjusts to fit better?)  Overall, I'm very happy I kept looking for a better mask, as not wearing one isn't an option.

The only thing that needs to be said is that I don't think these masks really provide any real protection. They don't have filters or filter pockets but they're very comfortable and convenient. If you need masks just to be in public but aren't particularly concerned with needing n95 protection, then these are a great choice

This product goes above and beyond with its customer service: I found that the masks I had ordered (size L) were a bit too small for me, so I emailed their support and they send me a pack of XL masks within a week! It turns out the XL masks were slightly too big for me, but that's my fault for not looking at the measurements beforehand.

  My first try at masks had about 5 layers of cotton, and while that may offer great protection, I could not breathe through them! These are much lighter and easier to use, fit my face and ear much better, and they are plenty thick enough to offer good protection without suffication. These are my new go-to masks.

  Finding a mask that you can tolerate for a whole work day can be challenging, but this provides the best comfort you could receive. The material is very soft and flexible while maintaining the shape of your face. I have not had to adjust or take off after long periods of use, which I usually have to do with my other masks. Obviously you can not expect perfection from having a piece of cloth on your face, you will still be annoyed with the occasional hot air against your face but the material is easy to breathe in. Make sure to choose the right size for your face before buying, do not just assume your size, measure first.

It gave me a whole new appreciation for the softness and the dip at the cheek bones so it doesn't push up at the bottom of my eyes. These also wash well. I would 100% recommend.

  Have bought several masks over the past months and they all slip off my face or stretch over time. I’ve had this one for several weeks now and still fits like a glove. No slipping. Lightweight enough that I feel like I can breath easily. Ordered the medium as I have a small face. Fits my teenagers faces as well. Ordering more!

  I picked these up as an alternative to the gaiter mask that I used while working out.  These masks are good.  I'm able to complete high intensity lifting and running workouts without any issue breathing.  Best part is, it covers up any bad breath I might have while lifting in the morning and it prevents others from seeing my awkward lifting faces.

  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I found the mask to be very warm on a warm day. I'm sure this won't matter so much as winter arrives, but for hot California summer days, I found I sweated in it, even while doing nothing more than walking around outside. Otherwise it is very comfortable.

  Finding a mask that fits and stays in place when you have a large face or a large beard is difficult, and I have both. These masks don't fit all the way over my beard, but they are large enough and elastic enough to stay in place while I'm talking with the mask on. They don't restrict my breathing a ton but they do a fantastic job at blocking my outward airflow. I sneezed yesterday with the mask on, and out of habit, I covered my mouth with my elbow. I didn't feel anything on my elbow at all.I'm giving up my go-to bandanas to use these because I like them so much.

  Great mask!  I’m super picky. Thin ear straps a must. Both sides soft. I prefer to have the polyester on the inside because cotton masks snag my stubble and the little fiber hairs tickle my nose. The nano cotton side did not seem to do that when I tried it but I’m just accustomed to having the polyester on the inside at this point. Very happy with the breathability. Also mask did not stink like some. Would prefer to have metal wire nosepiece but not a deal breaker. No itch.

After i got these and tried them on, I immediately felt a difference. I could wear these for hours if i had to ! veryyyyy comfy and way more breathable than surgical mask.

  I got tired of buying masks that were too small and ran across these with lots of people stating that it ""fit their big face"". Figured I would give them a shot and they were well worth the money. They are very soft (remind me of material used in women's bras). They were also pretty breathable in comparison to other masks. Best of all, they didn't shrink to half their size and still fit after running them through the washer and dryer (on low setting). The only thing missing is a metal strip around the nose, but I knew they didn't have those when I bought them.

  This mask is definitely larger than most.  the straps don't pull on my ears like regular masks that are too small.  the material is excellent and seems to be a nice barrier but still breathable.  i usually wearXXL hats if it means anything.Highly recommended for larger heads!

  Purchased these masks in the large and extra large, my husband and I are very happy with them. I will probably purchase the medium in the future. Although they dip under the eye, I still find myself having to adjust the mask to clear my view with the large mask. I love that the mask isn’t tight against my face, and my husband loves that the XL doesn’t pull on his ears while at work. Very soft!

  Very cheaply made and none too big. I’m not sure they provide much protection. I can’t wear them as they’re too small to fit comfortably around my ears, even fully stretched. They are essentially a couple of layers of slick, polyester-feeling material with very little stretch.

  I bought a pack of medium and a pack of large masks. I am a petite woman, and the medium fit me and my 14 year old son perfectly. The large fit my husband. For larger men with bigger, rounder faces, I might suggest the next size up from large. I cannot comment on the durability because I just received these, but they do seem to be of good quality. I can say that they are very lightweight and comfortable. I did wash them on cold in the machine and hung dry. They did not shrink and held their shape.

  We just got the ""mandate"" to wear a mask all day at work. I tried the homemade ones and they are hurt my ears with the elastic bands. These masks were a lifesaver, they are very soft and comfortable. I can forget I even have it on sometimes. The ear bands are soft and do not hurt your ears and the front is just the perfect size for my face and beard. These are the ones that I would recommend to anyone that has to wear a mask all day. I did get the XL size and it is perfect.

  These are very nice masks.  However, the sizing is pretty off.  I measured according to the photos with a soft tailor measuring tape and then selected my size accordingly. It's way too big.  I ordered a medium for 11 year old son (his measurements said he'd need a medium) and they are too big for him.  I'm an average sized woman and they are too big on me as well.  I'll probably try ordering the small size because they do seem like nice masks but it's very frustrating to have to go through the ordeal of returning them, especially right now.

  These masks could be great - they're comfortable and larger than others I've tried. However, there is no nose wire to help them conform with a secure fit. This is bad for protection and if you wear glasses, it makes the mask impossible to use. Every exhalation fogs your glasses, badly.

  Pros:Very comfortable. No longer feel like I am suffocating even when working outside in the Florida sun for 8 hours. Okay. It gets a little hard, but that’s because of the humidity and sweat. A quick rinse in the sink and it is ready to go again.Cons:Slightly too big. I tie a small knot in the ear loop and the fit greatly improves. My wife just ordered mediums, so maybe those will fit better.

  Exactly what I was hoping for. It’s like a dry-fit material so it’s nice and lightweight. I am a bigger guy and the large fits quite well. If you prefer it looser around the ears, perhaps try an xl but I’m happy with the fit of the large. The loops around the ears are very thin and don’t irritate your ears. Can’t wait until the mask days are over but until then I’m very happy with this mask.

  I absolutely love these masks!  They're great quality, well made and most of all comfortable.  It's the fist mask I've found that doesn't make me sweat when out and about here in Hotlanta.  Loved them so much, I've purchased 2 more times for gifts for my elderly parents and sister.

  Let me put it like this: One day at work I had to sit for an hour about 25 ft from where they were emptying the septic tank and I couldn't smell a thing. Also couldn't blow out a candle with it on. Not bad for a cheap cloth mask. Would have given 5 stars if it wasnt so loose around the nose, but honestly I have had to readjust every mask I've owned so far after speaking a sentence or two.

  Doesn't provide much protection along the sides of my nose, even though the mask fits snugly enough around the mouth—it needs a wire nose-piece so that the fabric doesn't leave gaps between the nose and the cheeks.  It is reasonably comfortable, although adjustable ear loops would be helpful because the tension is a bit too high for me.  Size Large—any smaller would be too tight.  I would've rather had one mask that fit well than three that don't...would be good if company sold these as individual masks to avoid waste (I didn't see them available in singles).

  Just FYI, I measured my face as recommended and used the sizing chart that is pictured. According to the chart, I was a medium. Just got them today (a week earlier than expected, which was nice) but they are way too big. I would definitely size down. I will have to put little rubber bands around the straps in order for them not to fall off my face. I do have a small head, but that is why I used the size chart. Bummer.

  These are a good size for teens or adults with a smaller face, but their shape seems almost molded, so that it puffs out over the nose and mouth area and looks truly bizarre and is probably an ineffective air filter. I had to return them.

  I bought these for myself because the the adult cloth masks don’t fit my face. I’m 26 & 5” so these fit perfectly. They’re not super tight nor are they super loose. They’re a soft material and do the job well. The only gripe I have is that the nose doesn’t really have a place to pinch it securely so that’s a little sketchy. But overall a great product.

  I bought these mask for my children.  I measured and ordered according to the size chart.  The mask arrived and are too big.  I had to adjust the straps around the ears to make them smaller and fit snug on their faces.  The mask themselves are also a bit large.  I would recommend to buy the smaller size recommended and not the size the chart recommends.  Other than that I like the mask.  They seem to be well made and comfortable otherwise.

The company was extremely responsive and great to deal with.I've ordered 4 sets of these masks, 2 sets of mediums (for my kids) and 2 sets of large (for myself). Sizing is inconsistent.  The last set of mediums (for my boys) won't even stay on their faces - they are so much bigger than the previous set.

  These are great, breathable masks I can wear for hours without ever feeling uncomfortable. We wash them in the dishwasher at night and use them every day. My husband and I got the large size and they fit us both well because they stretch.

  Ordered these masks in a large according to how to measure for this product. When received they were way too big for my face. Thought sure with virus they couldn't be returned so I washed and dried hoping they would shrink. Unfortunately for me, they did not. Superior quality, incredibly soft but still to big for my face. Still need masks for protection but now I have none.

  These masks are very comfortable. I took away one star for comfort only because these masks tend to slide off my nose while wearing them. They don't stay put. I fixed that by putting a little liquid latex inside the nose tip to hold it in place. Other than that they are great!

  Mask was purchased as a response to COVID protection guidelines.  Mask is well made. The sizing was an issue for me.  I ordered and wanted a medium sized, adult mask which should be larger than a small.  However, the mask is sized as a small/medium, no difference.  The next size large/extra large would have been much too big.  Although more costly for the seller and subsequently for the purchaser, I would recommend manufacturing four individual adult sizes - small, medium, large and extra large. Thank you.

  Okay so these are great masks with nice stretchiness to them! That being said I knocked a star off my review because I ordered a medium and when the masks arrived I was shocked by how small a medium was. I’m 5’7” slimmer build and smaller face (so I thought..) but when I tried all three on, they were so small that in order to cover my mouth fully, my nose was fully exposed. I reordered a larger size so hopefully those will fit better! But weird sizing aside, they are made from a very comfortable material and I’m excited for the larger size to arrive and hopefully fit much better.

  Still a bit big for a teen/small adult. Daughter uses only when doing outdoor activities and needs something to put on to make those around her comfortable as we pass.  I'm pretty sure this doesn't protect at all, but that's ok if outdoors.

  These are great for toddlers. My 2 year old has a hard time with most other masks poking her in the eye. The cut on these keeps the mask out of her eyes and she's more inclined to keep it on. She is 2 so it does come off but mostly from her wanting to talk without it on.

  These face masks are three layered so very protective. The good part is the ear loops are elastic so they can be adjusted on any face size unlike the cotton ear loops which have to be altered to fit your face.

  Very pleased with these masks.  Ordered for my spouse who is an older man and was having difficulty finding masks that were comfortable around the chin area.  These masks fit slightly under the chin and are not too tight so now he will wear one instead of removing after a short time.  I checked the fit on him and it is a secure but not uncomfortable.  He is happy, so I am happy he will have a product he will wear.

  These mask are really comfortable and fit well but they are waaaay too thin to be of any significant protection against germs. Even with 3 layers. I am able to feel my breath if I blow through the fabric. I know the description says non surgical but since it seemed such a popular purchase on Amazon I figure many people are buying it for protection against the virus. Too bad it doesn't have a pocket for some kind of filter.

As someone who struggles to find masks large enough to fit my face, this has certainly been a relief and I'm glad that this purchase was made. I will note that these masks seem to cause sweating a bit more easily but aside from that they're perfect for daily use in our current climate. Definitely recommend getting these.

  I have been looking for a comfortable mask to wear daily as I am required to at work. The Large is a perfect fit for my round face and I LOVE that it doesn’t touch my mouth and nose while adding the needed protection. I can talk with no muffling and breathe with no restraints. I receive many compliments and recommended to those with a round face. I ordered the Medium for my daughter because she has an oval face and it fits her perfectly. The Large was too big for her. I am 100 % satisfied with this product.

I can't open my mouth at all or it slips uncomfortably on my my nose and chin, and it won't stay in place. It's just the wrong shape for me, I guess.

They don’t breathe as well as cotton material, and if you have a beard the synthetic material rises down your face as you talk - leading to constant readjustment.

  The product was super comfortable and the material seemed to be of high quality. However, the size was far too small. I order the large one, and it barely covered my chin. I'm an average sized male with an average sized head, I would recommend to get the extra large one. Tis, a shame that it did not fit.

  I ordered the Xlarge for maximum coverage and it certainly does, despite not having the nose piece. It stays in place when speaking. My only complaint is the strings that cover your ears are somewhat frail and uncertain about their durability after repeated hand washings. However, they are very comfortable and breathable.

  As far as sizes go, as a thin person with small head--- I should have gotten a large. Their medium size is really more for a kid sized head. The mask does not stretch comfortably over my ears at this size.UPDATE: Although you still should be careful about selecting the mask sizes, Enerplex did me right and sent me larger ones at no cost. Gave the review a bump for excellent customer service.Now that it fits correctly, it feels nice and sporty.

There is a small pooch in the front that keeps them away from my mouth and gives room for my nose.  I am a woman so I would recommend a larger size for a man unless he wants the mask snug.

  Make sure to size up when you look at the size guide, I was on the larger end of the medium and the large mask fits me almost perfectly. My face gets a bit hot when I first put it on, but after around ten minutes it's all good. It's a great mask for those in the service or food industry; the straps don't hurt my ears, there are multiple layers that makes me feel safe and comfortable, and it doesn't make me overly sweaty or uncomfortable.

  Great comfort and fit for larger faces.  Good for longer wearing times.  Fits well around the ears with decent tension.  More tension with a little more stretch in the mask may allow better seal to help prevent fogging of glasses.  Mask can make breathing just a bit more difficult but still comfortable enough for extended wear.

  Really like the feel of this mask. Well-made, nice quality. Very soft and comfortable. Wanted white and Large was the only size available. A bit too big for me (med-small faced woman),  still wearable but loose. Even though it's wearable, I will give it to sons or husband since it is a better fit for them. Just wanted to comment on the good quality and comfort.

  My only issue with these masks is their fitting. I’m a grown man and they came very loose. As soon as I put it on my face it fell down below my chin. I couldn’t imagine them fitting properly on anyone, let alone a woman or child. My recommendation would be to cut the strap and tie it like a shoelace, then cut the excess string. Once you do this, though, the mask is great! Very comfortable, stylish and breathable. If the manufacturer can fix the sizing, this will be a great mask without any personal fixing.

  The masks are soft & comfortable, and wash well. I washed and hung to dry and they didn’t shrink and held there shape. The only thing was they could use a little more stretch in the ear loop. The fit was fine for me, however for my husband he would like more stretch for a more comfort, fit was a little snug for him. Otherwise happy with product.

  I was outside and thought to put the mask up into the light to see if it passes through. It does and it's worse when I used my phone's flashlight. This is not safe to wear if you're trying to protect yourself from Covid.

  The material is very light and comfortable.  The ear straps are very comfortable.  The shipping was ""same day delivery"" and the price is good.  The only negative thing about these masks is that they are just barely, meeting the size advertised.  We made sure to follow the cold water wash and air dry instructions but the masks just barely fit.  If I was to order more, I'd go up one size always.

  Having to wear a mask all day at work, I have gone through many masks, looking for the right fit and comfort. This mask fits the billing. The fit is more on the fuller side of your face, not too large, but fits across your face, not just centralized on your nose and mouth. This fit actually makes the mask more comfortable and easy to talk in. As a teacher, it is easy to talk through yet while feeling safe. 2 thumbs up, highly recommend!

Once you put on the mask it doesn’t drop below your nose and fits under your chin very comfortably. Follow the size that is given on the video if you want a good fit.

It's superior in every way, including fit, the fact that it extends just the right amount to be breathable, it keeps its form after washing, it's comfortable and doesn't make you feel warm. I've tried others masks. My research paid off, there's no comparison. A great mask at a good value. And superb customer service.

  I bought these for my kids for school. They are soft and comfortable.  They sit away from the child's mouth so they don't have to inhale fabric when they breath.  The font pull my child's ears forward and they don't ride up into their eyes either. If I have to purchase more I would probably buy these kind again.

  Not happy at all with this purchase.  Received the masks the other day, took one out of the bag to do a test fit. Masked fit great. Not too loose, not too tight. I washed it on cold, then dried on medium heat with other bits of clothing. The damn things shrunk.  F*&king useless now.  Material is Ok; There seemed to be room to add additional material if one wanted. Won't be buying again. If you do, may want to go a size up from what you normally order.

  These masks are great. Ordered medium in black.  Not hot, easy to wear. Design allows it to stay off my mouth.  I work in a school and I need to wear one all day.  It doesn't slide down over my nose when I talk as some others I have tried do.  Washes well.  Even went in dryer accidentally and it didn't shrink.  Just order 2 more sets.- Black again and light blue.

  The sizing chart and instruction is wrong. I followed it and purchased the XL size which was too large. If you’re on the upper end of the scale go down, not up.  The mask is way too hot and itchy to wear in summer weather. I could not wear this mask on warm to hot days. Would sweat too much under this mask. May be good in winter weather. Lastly, don’t wash in washing machine with other clothes. Color bled on to other clothes.

  The only thing I dislike about this product was that size regulation isn’t like every other brand and that seems to be an issue with all brands. Not all brands follow the same size regulation. When it comes this mask, I’m actually a medium to large, but when it comes to the under armor performance mask, I am an extra large. So just be aware when purchasing and picking a size.

  The mask was fine in terms of fit and breathability.  My son dislikes masks with seams going down the middle, but I don't mind.  We all agreed the biggest issue was the elastic part that goes behind the ears.  It is quite thick and uncomfortable - and made of something that feels close to tshirt material.  We prefer thinner elastic-type ear loops.

  Very comfortable and breathable! My only complaint is that it is loose around the nose area since it doesn't have that metal nose piece (I have a flatter nose bridge). I do find myself pulling it up more than my other masks. I gave one to my boyfriend and this is his favorite. He has a taller nose bridge and he doesn't have the same problem as me.

  I like this mask because it's light, comfortable and breathable and don't mind wearing it whenever I'm out in public as is required in my state to prevent spread of corona virus -- unlike other masks which I couldn't stand wearing.

  These are incredibly comfortable and well made. Fabric is soft, quality is great.My only wish is that they had a nose wire to keep the top more flush against my cheek. Missing this leads to foggy glasses. I’m going to try to add something myself.

  We ordered the 3-pack in small.  They fit our 4-year old girl well, once we tied knots in the ear straps.  Unfortunately the face height was too small for our 6-year old boy so it kept slipping off his nose, even though we had tied knots in the ear straps to fit him that direction.  We ordered a pack of medium to see if those fit him better.

  I am a big guy (6’3”) and about 260. The XL fits my face wonderfully. To my pleasant surprise, the fabric is more of a soft athletic fabric. Very comfortable and very stylish. Couldn’t be happier. The only slight on this product is I worry how long the ear straps will last. I will be hand washing this only and letting it air dry. Great deal!

  Product says large fits most adults, but the mask is so big on my face that even the motion of walking makes it slip right off my face after a couple steps. I'm a shorter female but I have a bigger head, even my boyfriend couldn't get these to stop slipping down. Defeats the point. Order a smaller size than large unless you're an absolute unit.

  These masks are the BEST I’ve found so far. They are very comfortable and breathable. Nice material, good quality. The XL size fits my full face just right. I just got my second set of black. I sent a set of blue (L) to my Aunt and she loves them. Highly recommended.

  I don't know what this company considers ""3 ply"", but these masks are not. They are soft, comfortable AND can be seen through, making them completely inadequate. We didn't expect an N95, but one that advertises as 3 ply, should be and one should not be able to see through the fabric.

They wash and hang dry well retaining original shape. They breathe well and don't muffle my voice. Will definitely buy more.

  I love the feel and fit of these masks and have been using them regularly since they arrived.  I find they can easily be adjusted either high or low on the bridge of the nose as well as the position under the chin.  The elastic ear loops are completely comfortable, unlike so many others.The only downside to these masks are that they are hot.  They seem to retain a bit too much moisture from your breath.  Not to the point of being soggy, mind you, but enough to feel a very heavy humidity.  For short trips out, say a gas station stop or a quick run into a store, no problem.  For longer outings they may become uncomfortable to some.  I wore mine to my wife's doctor's visit a couple of days ago.  We were in the facility - masks required - for about 1.5 hours and it was quite a relief to take them off at the car.Your mileage may vary.  My wife, for example, does not experience the same level of discomfort that I have with this mask at times.  But then, I tend to get too hot quickly and she does not.If you're like me, look for a mask with a valve.  If a basic, washable cloth mask suits you, then this is an excellent choice.  The 3-pack is quite handy, as there's always one available if the others are in the wash.Recommended with caveats as above.

  I would give 4 stars if not for the fact that fhe sizing chart is a bit off. I used a measuring tape for the bridge of my nose to my chin and it measured out to be about 5 and a half inches. The actual mask sits just below my chin making it slip off when yawning or coughing. As far as the effectiveness of the mask. The 3 layers aren't extremely tight woven which makes the mask absolutely wearable, however my concern is that it's not offering others around me as much protection as it could. I was able to blow a flame from a lighter out roughly 6 inches from my face. It is fairly comfortable beaides being a bit small. Would definitely order a size larger than the graph indicates.

  Nobody likes wearing a mask but these are nicely made. I like the contoured aspect compared to some others that we have.These are the Large Size and they fit me with a smaller face as well as my husband. I like how the contour fits up on my nose and that the bottom goes under my chin.These seem to have three layers. The other layer seems to be like a mesh looking fabric like athletic shorts might be made of. The inner layers seem to be like T shirt material. I feel these are plenty thick, and do the job to keep my breath droplets to myself.The elastic for the ears seems to have a coating sewn over it to make it more comfortable than just plain elastic. Ours have gone through the wash and washed up just fine. I did not take any special care with washing them. Just like my normal wash with no scents or fabric softeners...I do not normally use them anyway.We are happy with these masks and recommend them to anyone looking for washable masks.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks

  It’s 2020 and here I am reviewing face masks, who saw that coming. I tried on these masks when I first received them and before they were washed and dried. They were a little big and loose for my face. I couldn’t wear my glasses with them due to them fogging up.The masks did shrink a little after washing and drying which made them perfect for me. They fit my face better and I was able to even where my glasses. They’re breathable and lightweight. This pack comes with three face masks which I really needed.

  We got sets of these masks in both the large and XL sizes. The XL is about half an inch wider and half an inch taller. I wear a size 7.5 hat, which is large, but not extra large. The size large masks are snug around my ears. The size XL are more comfortable, but still secure. These masks do not have nose wires, but the stretchy hem and contoured fabric around the nose does help to keep my exhaled breath from from fogging up my glasses, especially on the XL mask that I can pull completely over my nose so my glasses sit on top of the mask to hold it down.These masks are 3-layer, which is much better than 2-layer for protection. The 3 layers are fairly thin and breathable, though, so I can still breathe comfortably when briskly walking outdoors.

  These EnerPlex XL Size White Face Masks are well made and comfortable but there is no nose wire so my glasses fog up.These are 3 layer masks with elastic around the ears. The mask is bound on all four sides with a ribbed, knit, fabric. The outside layer of fabric is a ventilated, knit, fabric. The inside layer is a jersey, t-shirt, knit. I cannot see the inner layer but the company says it is a tightly woven fabric. The workmanship is excellent and these masks are very comfortable.My family has large heads and faces and this XL size fits everyone very well. My husband and one son have beards and although their beards come out the bottom a bit, these still fit pretty well on them.My main issue is that there is no nose wire to bend and conform to your nose. Because of that, my glasses fog up quickly when wearing this mask. I solved the problem by applying one of these nose wires to the outside of the mask and it works well. https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Strips-Bridge-Bracket-Adhesive/dp/B087MZ5TGH/ Unfortunately, the adhesive on these metal strips don't hold up well to laundering so I have to put on a new one after I wash the mask. I will probably end up sewing a pocket onto the front of the mask to hold the wire in place permanently.I struggled with rating these masks. Because the nose wire is pretty important, I wanted to rate them 3 stars. However, it's hard to find large size masks and these are large and very well made so I am rating them 4 stars with the caveat that you will likely want to apply a nose wire for the best fit.

  I picked up the white ones because I intended on dying them various colors. The outer layer, trim and elastic takes the dye well, the inner layers stay white.  The bottom has a very generous chin cover - one of the best in this style mask. I've gone through a few different makes of this style mask and this is the best fitting and most comfortable so far. If you want to do some color customizing, the white is the way to go. It is a really sterile looking white - if you have dirty fingers, etc. they will get dirty pretty fast.The final photo is after a DIY blue job.They are vacuum packed and need to be washed before use. Really happy with these.

  I deleted my old review and had to knock this product down to two stars. I've bought 2 bags if youth/m for myself and 2 bags of large for my husband different times over the period of a few months. One bag of large only had one working mask because the ear elastics on the others were broken, the second bag of large came with all ear elastics intact but the masks were smaller than our first pack of large.... moving on to youth/Medium: the first bag of medium fit well on me and there were no issue, the second pack of mediums came with one medium and the other two were the same size as our larges. Order at your own risk. The quality control and sizing is clearly extremely inconsistent.

  This mask feels too thin. While it's undoubtedly no thinner than the blue surgical masks we're all wearing these days, it does not provide confidence; those masks at least have a built-in filter.PROS:- lightweight- really provides good coverage of your face- no gaps on the cheeks- better protection than a bandanaCONS:- huge gaps at the top of the mask by the eyes- minutes after removing the mask, I can still feel where the ear loops pulled on my ears- the mask just feels too thin- I have no confidence that this mask is capable of protecting me.BOTTOM LINE: If I wear this mask out of my home it's going to be with a blue surgical mask on under it.

  The size Small, EnerPlex Premium Kids Mask fits a 4 year old just fine and is soft and comfortable enough that he didn't mind wearing it.These are 3 layer masks. The outer layer is a soft, mesh-type, knit. The middle layer (although I cannot see it) is supposed to be a cotton blend. The inner layer (next to the child's face) is a knit, cotton blend that is slightly brushed so it feels really soft. The attached, elastic, straps are very soft and stretchy so they are comfortable behind the child's ears.These masks can be machine washed in cold water and tumble dried on low heat and you get a package of 3.Do note that there is no nose wire but they seem to fit snugly enough at the nose.I'm delighted to find a mask sized for a child. Our city has become a hot spot for coronavirus and masks only work if everyone is wearing one. I'm not sure a 3 year old would be able to understand to keep the mask on and not to touch it on the outside but many 4 year olds can follow those instructions for a non-extended period of time. These masks are a good choice, IMO. They would block most droplets if the child coughed or sneezed.

  This is a lightweight and stretchable mask that may well serve for many purposes, such as visiting the grocery store.

It is hard to tell how much protection it offers against viruses, though probably about the same level of other simple cloth masks.

  This is a lightweight and stretchable mask that may well serve for many purposes, such as visiting the grocery store. It is relatively comfortable and you can easily breathe through it, though it can slip off the nose when talking. It is hard to tell how much protection it offers against viruses, though probably about the same level of other simple cloth masks.

  Okay, first off - my face is small and I do not wear glasses so do not experience fogging.  This fits well my shape well and the pinch int he middle makes it easier to breath with a little space over my nose and mouth.  This just might be my favorite.

  I bought face masks for my family in March, the demand was so great that it took almost a month before they arrived.  So by the time we got them we'd been at home, social distancing and were  so so eager to wear masks outside.  But the ones we got were so hot and uncomfortable, they were made of a material that is similar to basketball shorts, (the shiny kind) over two layers of thick t-shirt material.  I felt like I was smothering.But these masks are a bit cooler, I was a teensy bit worried that the over the ear loops would be chafing or worse, fall off, but I wore them to the waterfront on a windy day and they were fine.The fabric is washable, but I'd put them in a lingerie bag, just in case.These don't have a pocket for a filter, but there is room for one of those bendable nose guard thingamajigs.All three of the face masks are black and since I want my husband and son to have their own I had to personalize each one.  I sewed different color sequins, one sequin each on the far bottom corners of their masks, it was subtle yet differentiated them; green for my son, silver for my husband.I've worried a little that the black mask might seem a little ominous, like we were bank robbers and we have gotten some angry looks from people for wearing them.  But those people can f*&^% off for all I care.  Wearing a mask is the least we can all do to protect ourselves and others.

  These EnerPlex Youth/Adult Small Size Blue Face Masks are perfect for smaller faces.These are 3 layer masks. The outer layer is a soft, mesh-type, knit. The middle layer (although I cannot see it) is supposed to be a cotton blend. The inner layer (next to your face) is a cotton blend knit that is slightly brushed so it feels really soft. All sides of the mask are bound in self fabric. The attached, elastic, straps are very soft and stretchy so they are comfortable behind your ears.These masks can be machine washed in cold water and tumble dried on low heat and you get a package of 3.Do note that there is no nose wire but they seem to fit snugly enough at the nose.I'm delighted to find a mask sized for smaller faces. Regular sized masks just swallow my daughter's face but these are a very good fit. Our city has become a hot spot for coronavirus and masks only work if everyone is wearing one. Because these are 3 layer and stretch to fit snugly on the face, these masks are a good choice, IMO. They would block most droplets if you coughed or sneezed (as long as you are wearing it correctly so that your nose and mouth are covered.)The truth is, social distancing and frequent hand washing are our best defense against coronavirus but for times when you must go to the grocery store, bank, gas station, etc, a mask will protect others in case you are unknowingly infected. If everyone is wearing a mask, we are ALL protected.

  I wear a size 7.5 hat, which is large, but not extra large. Many of the one-size-fits all face masks are too small for me and are either uncomfortable to wear or don't cover my nose and mouth well. These XL masks fit great. Width fits comfortably around my ears despite the thin and not very stretchy straps. Height covers my whole chin and my whole nose. There is no nose wire adjustment, but because the mask is large enough to cover my whole nose, I don't get foggy glasses like with smaller masks. These masks are made from 3 thin layers of woven cotton, so may not filter as well as the masks that have a thicker non-woven inner layer. On the plus side, it is easier to breath through than the thicker masks.

  I purchased a different set of masks on Amazon and was pleased with them...until these arrived.Though, I can't say I had any experience with masks prior to the pandemic so I only have the masks I originally purchased to compare these to.These masks are not flimsy, the fabric is double layered, a nice weight and weave.  The elastics are very comfortable on your ears.  I received size large and I have an average sized head/face and it fit perfect.  I would say my father has a larger head/face and this mask also fits him perfectly.  My mother is tiny though (5' tall and maybe 80lbs soaking wet) so it is bigger on her but not as much as you would expect.These are very, very nice masks.  Comfortable when worn and not as sty-fulling as the original masks I bought.if you are in need of masks, as we all are, you should definitely consider getting these.I hope my humble opinion helps you in some way.Thank you for reading.

  I got the EnerPlex face masks in XL because my husband has a large head. Fortunately I can wear these too. The only color available  at that time was white or I would’ve gotten a different color, but white is okay.These are comfortable, especially compared to some masks which are stiffer. They came through the wash in good shape. Instructions are to wash before wearing the first time.  Do not use fabric softener. I would wash in non-toxic, unscented detergent because this is going to be over your nose and mouth.I read that the lining is treated with Agion.  Supposedly this contains copper and silver, which is antimicrobial, “Agion is designed to automatically release its antimicrobial components ONLY when conditions for bacteria growth are present.”This seems to be a good product. If you are in a high-risk environment, consider wearing a face shield plus the mask.

  After going through the majority of the COVID-19 crisis with a homemade mask made from two layers of an old pillowcase, it's nice to have something that's better made, better looking and better fitting.These are very basic - plain white, three layers.  They fit snugly over my mouth, chin and up the bridge of my nose so I feel secure when I go out in public.  The fabric is soft, slightly stretchy and feels both comfortable and breathable.Nothing special, but they definitely get the job done.

  I cannot say enough good things about these masks.  I am VERY reluctant to spend this much on masks when you can get them for $5 or less.  But these are so comfortable I am willing to.  I have recommended these to countless people and I've had to buy more because my teens fight over who gets these, they could care less about the pricier ""sports"" ones or the custom designer ones, they want these.  They are soft and oh so breathable.  You do not get hot wearing these at all.  The multiple size options mean you get a much better fit than just ""adult"" or ""child"" size.  The ear loops do not bother me at all.  I have machine washed AND dried these and they come out just like new.  They are well worth the price.

  These face masks are the best fitting masks I've used. They don't fog up my glasses and fit my larger head. The only issue is they are almost too tight and my head isn't even that big. So I'd recommend ordering up a size so they don't fit too tight.These are pure white and stain easily but that's actually a good thing because they need to be washed regularly and the white gives the appearance of being clean. These can be bleached as well since there is no color to them. Elastic seems to be good quality and should hold up well over time. Overall, these are very nice but I'm not sure the sizing is right. I like the 3 pack, it allows me to always have one ready to go when the other 2 are dirty or in the wash.

  I wasn’t sure what to expect from these, but I was pleasantly surprised.  They are large, soft, and comfortable.  I upgrade the protection of masks by placing a disposable shop towel over the mask and holding it in place with a section from nylon pantyhose (these are ideas from the internet, not my original).But that’s JustMe.

  After having a horribly frustrating experience trying to get face masks off of Etsy, I was lucky enough to be able to get these in a time where facemasks were difficult to find.  I have been using this 3 pack often for every trip into a public space.I like that you’re getting 3 of these so I can alternate between washings.  They are all exactly the same size, shape and quality. They fit very well and are, dare I say, flattering.  They are neither too tight or two loose and I feel confident in their fit and function.  They are not so heavy that you feel like you’re suffocating, as with some other masks I’ve tried.  They do not slip or come loose at all.These have been easy to wash and continue to use, they have not faded or been damaged in any way. Again I will mention how awesome it is to have 3 of these both for cleanliness and for ease of always having a mask within arms reach (in my car, in my home or in my purse).I would purchase these again if needed and would (and have) recommend these

  These masks fit their description. They're comfortable and very soft against the skin. Their material is lightweight and feels like what a sport t-shirt is made of. The ear loops are soft and stretchy and allow the masks to rest on the face comfortably. They are also true to size. I'm not sure how much protection they offer during the COVID-19 pandemic. I suppose it's the same level of protection as a bandanna or scarf. They hold up well to machine washing and drying, which is a plus. I only wish that the manufacturer would make a pocket for a filter on these masks. That would make them much more effective for what most people are wanting them for.For those of you keeping score, here's the breakdown:Design- AComfort- AFit- APracticality- B-Ease of Use- AEase of Care- AValue- BOverall Grade: B+

  These masks do feel good against the skin. I like that you can get them in different sizes instead of a one-size mask that may or may not fit. Overall, they're pretty comfortable to wear and they're easier to breathe in than some others we've tried. And that's also where the only real drawback comes in. I can easily breathe in, but when I breathe out it feels like the warm air is trapped inside and it gets pretty warm inside the mask. Considering the current conditions, pulling the mask away from my face isn't really a good idea, so it gets uncomfortable after a bit, especially if it's warm wherever I am. I have noticed that it isn't as bad when it's cooler. Basically, these are comfortable as far as the way the fabric feels against your skin and they are well made. If they could find a happy medium for when a person exhales, these would be darn near perfect.

IF they were a little easier to breath in, they would be perfect for long work hours too i think but, still they are a lot easier to breath in then others IMO. most probably would be okay breathing in these indoors for long periods of time, i normally am so i think the times i was not was just because temps & humidity were too high for me here..

  These are my go-to masks. I love that they are soft, flexible and 3-ply.  You can machine wash these and make covid times just a bit easier where masks are mandated.  Super comfortable to wear.  Large fits my large face and XL fits faces with any sort of beard.  Solid recommend.

  My mother actually bought a couple sets of these for my children (2nd and 3rd grade) in a size small. These are honestly the best fitting masks we have come across for their little faces and seem comfortable to them. They also don't seem to come down off the nose while talking as much as some of the other masks we have tried do. They are probably my favorite as far as fit and material. I just hope this brand looks into doing some fun little designs for kids eventually, because of course, as with most kids, they are more excited about wearing them when they feature designs they like. I know that's not most important, but coming from a child's perspective, they are emire willing to keep them on if they have cute designs on them.

  My son loves his mask. He is only two and isn't required to wear one but if course he wants to because everyone else is. I like that it is just his size and it is so soft it doesn't bother him. The only reason I give it a for star is because it doesn't for well around his nose when he talks or opens his mouth it moves off of his nose. It doesn't have a right grip around it and he is always readjusting it which defeats the purpose

  Hands down the best face mask I’ve used so far, 3 layers thick so it offers optimal protection for a cloth mask while still being breathable. The xl fits both myself (average face size for a female adult) and my husband (more area to cover plus a beard). The elastic is thin and soft, but stays in place without pulling or falling down. If you need a face mask just to get groceries or for a full day at work I recommend these.

  I have a problem with almost every face make, this one included, in that I wear glasses and trying to breathe through a mask and NOT have my glasses fog up is just unrealistic.  I definitely prefer these soft material face masks over the disposable paper ones.  I have gaiters that I use as well, but the fact that they cover my neck just adds to the heat during summer.  These are the best type of mask for me.

  Very happy with these masks. I bought the large and they fit well for me, an adult male with a biggish head—very comfortable. They are soft, pliable, and easy to breathe through. For a mask that's made to stop us from spreading diseases to others, this definitely does the trick. When I want more protection (for me from others) in stores, I slip a KN95 mask underneath it and tuck in the straps—no need to strap on one, then strap on the other over it. When I leave a store, I just pull out the KN95 mask and this mask stays on.  Because this mask is stretchy enough, it can accommodate this maneuver, which is an extra plus. (Recommending these masks to family and friends.)

  The EnerPlex face masks are really soft, breathable and lightweight. Wearing one at work for 8 hours was much more comfortable than wearing a disposable mask. I REALLY like that I can just hand wash it at night and the next morning have a clean one ready to go. The mask is slightly tighter that I'd like, so on a reorder I will get the next size up. Overall - 5 stars!

  Even though the pandemic might be winding down here, restrictions being lifted, I will still be wearing a mask to see how things go. And these are a welcome addition. Up to now we've been using the cheapie paper masks and they just don't last and the straps break easy.But these masks are quality made and heavy duty. They fit well on my face and I like that fact that you can wash them and re-use them, very handy.Have not used that much yet, but so far I gladly recommend.

  I like these. I was finding the disposable masks felt a little too small for my face so I decided to try taking these in XL. I'm happy with the resulting fit. They fit but they're still snug enough to do their job (I think). They are comfortable to wear, breathable and don't bother my ears. And I can get them adjusted on my face so they don't fog up my sunglasses.They don't have any wire stiffener at the bridge of the nose but I'm guessing that would make them unwashable.

Because the masks are 3-ply (have 3 separate layers of fabric), they will do a better job of protecting my husband and me from the virus.

  These masks are fairly comfortable to wear. The fabric is soft and the ear loops are stretchy. I was hoping that maybe these would fit my kids, but these are definitely more suited for teens or smaller adult faces. There is no metal in the nose-piece, so it may not be quite as form fitting as it could be, but the shape and the design does seem to fit fairly close to the face - which is good.The fabric is fairly breathable and I like the blue color.

  I am making homemade masks, but I wanted to try some masks that are mass-produced to see how they feel and fit. I found these very comfortable and lightweight. I’m not sure I’m thrilled with the polyester and I think overall I prefer my 100% cotton home-made masks better.Be aware though, this mask is treated with “Agion” antimicrobial agent. This chemical is used by businesses and hospitals to treat surfaces and guard against covid-19/corona virus. It is effective, although Kaiser Permanente recently stopped using this chemical (I’m not sure why, but I’m assuming because of safety concern).By googling “Agion” I was able to find some information about this chemical, but I am not convinced it is safe.For this mask, the Agion is applied to the inner layer of the mask. The mask is composed of 3 layers as follows:Shell layer: 100% polyester DWRMiddle Layer: 65% polyester, 35% cottonInner Layer: 65% polyester, 35% cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agentYou absolutely need to wash these before wearing them. They recommend it on the package and with the chemical treatment I think you should not wear this mask right out of the package. I am washing before using, but I am not sure that washing actually removes this chemical.I am also somewhat apprehensive wearing these masks. I don’t know that I trust the manufacturer of the chemical who says it is “totally safe”. There’s so many chemicals that have been used throughout human history that end up being cancer causing, so I am very much apprehensive that this chemical  is “safe”.I really wanted to give these masks a good rating, but just the fact they don’t disclose this chemical is used on the product on the Amazon product page, makes me even more apprehensive. Why did they apply it? Is it removed with washing or does it stay on the fabric long-term. From what I gathered from my internet research, the chemical will be effective for 90 days when used on surfaces.I doubt most people would even know since the packing is usually just thrown out by the consumer. I can not in my right mind give this product a good rating.

  Generally, I think you get what you pay for, so don't expect too much from a mask that only costs $6.33.  The fit and stretchiness are okay.  I am an average-sized adult male so I bought Large, which is a bit loose.  Maybe it'll shrink a little when I wash it.  If you are looking for 100% cotton, keep looking.  The packaging indicates that the outer shell is 100% Polyester DWR (Durable Water Repellent), the middle layer is 65% Polyester & 35% Cotton, and the inner layer is 65% Polyester & 35% Cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent.  Combined, the three layers of fabric are not very breathable.  I have no significant difficulty inhaling through the mask, but when I exhale the mask traps a lot of the moisture, which then is forced out around the edges.  Since there is no wire to form-fit the mask to your nose, a lot of the exhaust goes out the top, which fogs up my glasses.  Disposable masks with the wire at the bridge of your nose are better at mitigating this effect.  I can use these masks for short periods of time, like a trip to the grocery store, but I couldn't wear it for hours.  It's too steamy.

  The quality and material where exactly what we were looking for. They are very comfortable to wear. I would have given 5 stars except for the size inconsistency in my 2 orders. As you can see in the picture I received my first order of 3 large masks which came with a wider ear elastic (the top picture). These were great and perfect for my husband for work. He liked them so much I placed a second order for the same size large masks. I  received the masks (in the lower picture) which are smaller and have thinner ear elastics. I was upset about the size inconsistencies but since they fit me I will keep the second order. I have recommended them to family with caution as they may get masks that are different in size. They are made in Vietnam. I would order another set if I knew I was getting the wider ear elastic with the larger sized mask for my husband. Both packages were sealed and labeled as large. Not sure maybe the first order was really an XL in a “large“ label package??? I will watch other reviews for inconsistencies to see if I should place another order.

  These are OK.  The fit is a little weird even though I used the measurement guide on the product description.  They are a bit bulky and not super fun to breathe thru, definitely would not want to wear these all day, but for a quick trip somewhere they work.  The fabric is soft and the elastic is stretchy.  Overall, I don't love the fit or feel of them, though.

  I bought the large. I am a big guy (280 lbs) with some facial hair and the large is a good fit. It's great to have the elastic stretch generously and comfortably. For eyeglass wearers like me some fogging may occur depending on how I place it on my face. They look good, they are quality made and they are comfortable, but they could be more breathable as it does get warm under there.

  I bought these masks to take in the glove box of our car. We normally don't wear masks, but some stores won't let us in without them. The masks fit well and are relatively easy to breath through. They are fairly comfortable and are re-washable for continued use. Note: The instructions say to wash the masks before first use.

  My wife and I have gone though many mask types in search of the perfect one.. this is close to perfect, except I do still fog my eyeglasses.  The ear straps are more comfortable than most, as they are a spaghetti-type of elastic.  The fabric is soft, and the way it is stitched, the center line doesn't lay right on your face.

  This ""xl"" mask is barely larger than a standard mask and is much too small if you have a beard. The loose weave fabric is useless for preventing the spread of germs (I blew out a candle with the mask on just to prove this point). I would return them if I could.  Shame on this vendor for taking advantage of the pandemic to make a quick buck selling shoddy masks.

  The sizing for these are getting worse and worse. When I first bought a kids small pack, they fit my kids great. The second time they were a little big and I had to tie the loops for them to fit my 5 year old, but it still slips down often and it is too big for my 3 year old. The most recent time, the size is huge and definitely adult sized and not child sized.They are also starting to fray on the edges after about 6 washes.

  **UPDATE - 3 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS WONDERFUL IN FIXING ISSUES....Nice fabric. I was expecting it to be too thin but its enough for me to be comfortable with my children wearing. I bought the small/kids size for my 5 year old and 8 year old. It fits my 8 year old odd, the material in not wide enough to keep her nose covered when she talks and the bands are too loose around her ears. My 5 year old has a small face and her nose bridge is pretty flat and they don't fit at all, too big on her. I wish there was a metal wire to bend around the nose area for a better seal. There really needs to be a wire for the nose bridge with the such odd fit for both kids. The company uses a chemical on the masks that they dont disclose of untill you open the package and read everything. Very frustrating. Many people probably don't even notice. I will post pics of the ingredients that came on paper with the masks. The masks are next to a small female hand. These run very odd in size for kids.

  I have bought at least 8 different masks now. I have given all of them to my boyfriend and son because they are all way too large for my face. I am a petite 5'1"" woman and bought the medium (youth). They fit perfect and I am glad I can finally stop looking. I do feel that they are much thinner than I was expecting and much, much thinner than the homemade mask I have been using. I do not feel safe wearing just one of these. I have been doubling up. I wish they were thicker or had a filter insert.  But I am at least happy to have found the perfect size.

  This fits like a dream! It conforms to my face very well. It’s also the most comfortable mask I’ve worn, and I’ve had to wear a variety of masks. Very easy to clean and carry around with you. It doesn’t feel like it’s impeding my breathing, and it curves away from the lips, so you’re not rubbing your lips raw and chapped every day. Which was a big consideration for me. As an essential worker, I have to wear a mask 5 days a week for about 8 hours a day. Chafing and chapping was a big concern of mine. I just wish that they carried them in a few more colors. I would definitely buy these again!

  Product advertised as 3 ply.  Although I did not cut it apart, it is obviously 2 ply, and a thin 2 ply at that.  They advertise it a light weight, and that part is true.  I am not able to determine the type of fabric used.  There is no provision for a crimp seal at the nose, but that was never advertised as being there.  If you are getting this for virus safety, don't waste your money. Made in Vietnam, but that would not be a problem if the quality was decent.  The only purpose this mask serves is if you are required to wear a mask, you can say you are.  Might also be useful for bank holdups.

  They seemed ok, but they are not nearly as large as they claim.  Based on the measurements they show on their pictures, the “large” size should have fit my face just fine. But they won’t even cover my chin and nose at the same time. My face measured 5.5”.However, I decided to return the large and try the XL, as they seemed ok otherwise. The only part they lack on first observation was an adjustable nose piece.

  These are the perfect mask to wear all day. They are little warmer than the paper surgical masks, but more comfortable. The large size fits my face well. The mask size has good coverage and ear loops are the perfect length so that they’re not tugging on my ears. I liked these so much I bought two packs so I could keep tossing them in the laundry after a few wears, have some in the car, purse, or wherever, so I’m prepared.I should note that I work at a hospital and am used to wearing the surgical masks all day, which actually have been fairly comfortable compared to some other cloth masks I purchased that will likely never use because they’re not the right size or comfortable for me to wear.I recommend these masks over anything else I’ve tried... and that’s saying a lot since I sunk a lot of money in trying different kinds from Amazon and Etsy.

  These masks can fit into any lifestyle. They are very comfortable and fit snug but not tight on your face. They kind of have a cloth-mesh feel so they are good for working out/running if you need to wear one while doing so. They look very stylish and I've gotten compliments on them from people who wear the disposable ones. If they don't fit right the first time you put them on, it may be upside down as that happened to me.There are three downsides to these masks. They do not have a nose clip, so the mask can slide down pretty easily. Also after a few washes, I've noticed the elasticity of the material is starting to wear making the masks less snug. I don't know if this will get worse as I wash them more, but just an observation from how my mask fits now vs when I first got them. The ear loops are not adjustable, so be sure to order the correct sizing.Overall I would recommend these if you are looking for a comfortable mask that can be used for different activities and abide by the mask laws.

  I generally wear surgical masks or KN95 ones for the best protection in public but when I walk briskly for exercise outdoors, they quickly saturate with sweat and become ineffective. Neck gaiters and vented masks put others at risk so that’s not an option for me. These are a good compromise.They don’t saturate with breath/sweat as fast and quickly dry out once removed. I tried silicone frames but the masks saturated just as fast - I just couldn’t feel the clamminess on my face. Once the cloth gets wet, air escapes around the edges and my glasses fog, despite adding self-stick malleable nose strips.For everyday use, these are comfortable and durable, and adding a nose strip reduces eyeglass fogging once I get the mask-tightener adjusted just so.  Just reordered!

  I have bought both large and XL versions of this mask. The large fits ok and the XL fits well and seems to be sized for the ""widening"" head of the older male. For short trips out, I use the large and use the XL for more active forays into the world of viruses. I washed them before using and did not detect shrinkage. The price was only relatively competitive, but the delivery time was excellent. I have used a lot of paper masks and a wide variety of clever neck gaiters since the epidemic threatened my life, and these masks are now my first choice.

  I have a very normal sized head. No beard. I am male, 5' 10"" tall an 170 pounds (so you can compare yourself and your face/build to mine). I have a normal sized jaw, maybe a bit square, but very normal. My nose is British in nature, so a bit larger than normal, but not huge. Disposable blue masks with the metal strip stay on my face just fine, but they have large air gaps on the sides and are only 1-ply. Literally every, single cloth mask I have used slips off of my nose with every word I speak. Pulling your mask back up over your nose, every 5 seconds while you talk is our new national habit.This XL mask DOES NOT SLIDE OFF OF MY NOSE WHEN I TALK!!! It does not have any air-gaps on my cheeks. It rides a tiny bit high on my nose so it is visible at the bottom of my field of vision. But that is a small price to pay for a mask that stays on my nose. I am a teacher. I talk for a living. I require protection from the little germ factories in my classroom. It is not safe or reasonable to have my mask slip off of my nose every 5 seconds (not hyperbole, literally every 5 seconds).This is the mask you need if you are just fed up with the whole ""slipping off of your nose"" thing.If your face is small, or perhaps your are female, you might want the L size. You would need to have a real small face for any other size.Recommend.

  The facts are that this product is exactly as described. It does exactly what the sellers say it does. I’m giving a one star because the whole idea that we have to wear masks everywhere now in the first place is completely pathetic and ridiculous and I never thought our country would come to this.

  I've been really hesitant to buy masks and have been nipping off the free disposable ones I get from work. I figured just because the president is an idiot doesn't mean I have to spend $30 on a bunch of masks for my family.These are so much more comfortable than the disposable ones, I regret not doing it sooner.I have a pack of the black and white. Black I use for indoor use and I'll use the white when I'm outside in the heat. I've noticed a significant difference in comfort when wearing the white vs black mask in the sun. The black mask makes me feel so much hotter, but both are equally comfortable from a softness and fit perspective.I wear an XL hat and helmet, and I feel like these are a good fit. Probably have room for a little bit bigger of a head, and I'd wonder about the protection if my head was much smaller.

  I bought these knowing that face masks (whether effective or not) would soon be mandatory where I live ... and now they are.These masks are pretty comfortable, though just like any mask, they take a little getting used to. The coverage is good and they don't feel like they're gonna rip your ears off or make your ears stick out like you're ready for take-off on a windy day. The elastic ear bands are a bit on the cheap side. That's not a big deal if you can locate some extra elastic in case they need replacing.The instructions say to wash before wearing, and I suggest you do so. Let them air dry if you can, they'll probably last a little longer that way. I live in Arizona, so with the low humidity, they dried real quick. Overall the quality is in the ""better"" range.Stay healthy.

  As a critical essential infrastructure employee who travels for a living, I've had to wear masks around the country for months now.  As such, I've tried more than a dozen different masks from traditional surgical masks to homemade masks to various commercially available masks up to and including an RZ Mask.These masks are the best combination of comfort and value that I've found.The material seems to 'breathe' a bit better than thick cotton masks, minimizing that hot feeling - especially if you need to wear it outside.  They are lightweight and easily stuffable in a pants pocket, have a good amount of stretch on the mask itself and the earpieces, they don't move around too much when I talk or am chewing gum, the cut of the mask itself is very ergonomic and conservative in appearance (good for business), they seem well-assembled, and most important to me they're the most comfortable that I've found for wearing over extended periods.I wasted a lot of money on masks with clever patterns that were poorly constructed and fit like garbage - should have just bought these.  I rarely give emphatic reviews but these masks are the best option I've come across yet.

  These are awesome! The most comfortable and best fitting masks that I have found for kids. My son is 7 1/2 and quite big for his age. The size small fit him perfectly with a little bit of room. I have not washed these in the washing machine, planning to hand wash so that they do not shrink. But they have a good amount of stretch and are soft. Not too thick or thin- nice and breathable. Ordered some for me and my husband as soon as we got these!

  These masks are slightly more comfortable than the blue surgical masks. It still pulls too tight on the tip of my nose.Anybody who says they don't fog up your glasses is crazy. These fog up my glasses to the point where I would rather just toss them in the trash.One of the 3 masks has a huge discrepancy in the length of the elastic that goes around your ears. One side pulls tighter than the other so can't wear that one at all.One of the 3 masks has a big dimple in the center of the mask like it was stitched too tight in that area.I have to talk while wearing a mask at my job. It does not stay on your nose as soon as you open your mouth. And yes, I ordered the right size according to the measurement chart. Pretty much these masks are an all around failure, especially for the price.I think somebody needs to design a mask that has the metal piece in the bridge of the nose AND a metal piece that can be curved in the opposite direction to hug your cheek.I would not recommend these. I am going to try something else.

  I bought these because the masks we had made at home I really didn't like. These are made of a nice looking lightweight fabric that is relatively comfortable. The elastic for the ears is a round ""cord"" like kind. I wasn't sure how it would pull on my ears but even on my big head and ears it seems to be comfortable. There is no wire around the nose to squeeze and make a secure fit but I knew that going in and I'm ok with that. The fabric doesn't seem to attract lint or dust and is easily cleanable if it does. Wearing a mask takes a long time to get used to so I'm not sure that any other mask I try on would feel any better. You're always going to be blowing hot air in your face and and fogging your glasses. I don't think there is any way around that. These are no different. All-in-all these will work for me until this madness ends.

  These masks are fantastic!  Since there are four (4) sizes — small, medium, large, and extra large — these masks can fit anyone.  Buying the correct size makes a difference — so, you need to carefully consider the size chart provided with the listing before you make your purchase.There are NO smells for these masks other than the ones added by the user when the masks are washed; there were no odors when purchased either, but I washed the masks as directed by the manufacturer, before using the masks.  So, my masks now have a fresh Tide fragrance.I have purchased several types of masks and, based on my comparisons of these masks to the others, I can state that these are the best.  Although there are no metal nose pieces, you can buy self-adhesive metal nose pieces to add to the masks, if desired.  These masks are soft and breathable, and they fit great:  these masks are a perfect choice, and I highly recommend them.

  Perfect fit for my adult petite face. The Lord compelled me to order N95 masks 3 years ago, so I bought a few just in case - even one for my adult son. Here we are 3 years later and being forced to wear them. Since the COVID19 shut down I have ordered others trying to find a better fit because I have a petite child like body size the originals I ordered were on the big side. I have ordered different brands with no luck.Now that many brands are making youth size I ordered these and they are a perfect fit. Breathable, moisture resitant, and comfortable - which is key since we sometimes have to wear them for hours. I highly recommend this product.

  If it hugged tighter around the nose, this would be decent. It's super soft, the seam is made so there's a decent gap between the mask and my mouth, and doesn't pull on the ears... But as it is, the gap along the sides of my nose means practically all the air movement is through that gap and straight up my glasses. Keeps them quite throughly fogged up even with a fresh coating of anti-fog on them.And it hooks a bit too well under the chin. One good yawn will pull it completely off my nose. I'm touching my face entirely too much while out and about, constantly rearranging the thing or holding it around my nose so I can see.

  I have literally ordered these Enerplex Masks for my entire family! The masks stand head and shoulders above anything I have ordered on Amazon or Etsy, or have had made locally - and I have tried many, many types. Pictured is my father, a VERY active senior citizen, who has had zero complaints with THESE. He tells all his friends about them. The materials are soft, very breathable, and cool. Multiple sizes ensure a perfect fit (my father and most of my family wear the large comfortably. My brother is a big man and wears the XL, his petite, teenage girls wear a medium.) The seam down the middle allows the mask to fit well over the nose and under glasses, but allows for just enough room around your mouth to not feel ""trapped."" The elastic is comfortable and durable, but does not interfere with eye glasses and does not tug on your ears. The stitching is well done and even. As far as style goes, I think these are about as sophisticated as a mask can get. (In the photo, the mask looks a bit gray due to the camera's flash, but the mask is indeed black.) Well done Enerplex! THANK YOU!

  They seem great. They are very soft and easy to breathe through. It is this, however, that makes me rate it lower. They are TOO easy to breathe through. I am unsure of how much protection I am offered from the environment, although I am reasonably certain that the environment is protected from me. I am rating them a 4 (I would give another half star, but there is no option to do that - so really, 4.5 is my rating) because they did not come with a filter pocket. I was trying to find exactly how much filtration they offer and really could not find any information on how much protection the inner layer has against particulates (does it block up to 30%, 50% 80%, etc).  Cambridge Analytics did a study on different materials and their efficacy against viral sized particulates, and the material they suggested that works best seems to come close to what the Seller has used. I have asked the seller exactly how much protection they offer. If they come back with an answer that satisfies me, I will change my rating to a 5. They really are nice masks and very comfy. I would trust these for protection from fire, smoke, etc. We have a problem with brush fires in my area, and these would do well with that.

  Mask are mandatory at my work and I tried a lot of different one's before finding these. Only draw back is that they don't have a nose clip. They fit very well and are large enough to completely cover my nose and chin. I added an adhesive nose clip (i reviewed the ones that work the best) and this is the perfect mask for work. If you have to wear one and you're a bigger guy, these are the ones to get.Pros:-Fitted for your nose and don't ride on your mouth.-Soft and comfortable!-Extra large, you're not tugging it in place all the time.-Very thin ear elastic keeps your ears from getting sore, most comfortable on the ears by far!-Durable, I have to wear them 5 days a week, I have wash them in a small garment bag and there is no fraying or seam splitting at all.Cons:No nose clip, but this is easily fixed with an adhesive nose clip (see my review for nose clips as well)All in all, the best option I have found so far!

  These had a really funky smell when they first arrived, so I recommend washing them first before you wear them.They are indeed very light-weight as described. I was looking for another option as we currently use the disposable masks - I wanted something just as breathable, especially in Texas heat. I read a ton of articles and these were always ranked as the best - so I gave them a try.To me, they aren't super breathable. Sweat gets caught in much easier and I found them to be quite large as well, so they ride up to my eyes and I have to pull them down. I may order another size down and see if this helps.However, they unexpectedly surprised me (and this is the reason why I'm keeping them!) because they do not cause your glases to fog!Overall, worth buying if you don't plan on wearing your mask for long periods of time. The weather is also cooling down so it may make these more comfortable.

  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and bought size Medium for myself, my 13 yo daughter, and my boyfriend. Not sure why they’d callThen youth masks because they’re certainly large enough for the average sized adult. A large would’ve been too big. The ear straps will probably take some getting used to as they were comfortable for about 2-3 hours then started to really hurt. We bought them for the gym and while breathable they really get like a soggy cloth sitting on my face so these are probably not for exercise.

The ear straps will probably take some getting used to as they were comfortable for about 2-3 hours then started to really hurt. We bought them for the gym and while breathable they really get like a soggy cloth sitting on my face so these are probably not for exercise.

  These masks are made of a thin knit material, and regardless of the manufacturer stating the number of layers, per researchers, knit fabrics are completely unusable and ineffective preventing COVID getting through. I've just wasted my money, and should have continued making my own, two or three layers of the recommended thick 100 percent cotton fabric.

  I find this mask to be comfortable. Fit is good. I have to get used to it in increments tho. I have advanced stage COPD and have to be on oxygen almost totally. I also live in the Gulf South. I am also  elderly. There ya' go. With the oxygen tubing and having to use my cane or walker sometimes, it's a challenge to move easily. The high humidity makes it harder. While the mask is mandatory here I still don't find it easy to wear. This is a nice mask, it's not heavy and the straps for the ears are also soft and not uncomfortable. The breathing difficulty I have is strictly on me, not the mask. I'd recommend it to anyone that needs to wear one. For elderly, in my situation, I'd say just give it a chance to work and it would be worth it. Good price, it looks durable and do, follow instructions,  as to giving it a cold wash and let it air dry before you wear it. It didn't take very long to dry.

  I cannot blow out a candle/lighter with these masks on, which is my go-to effectiveness test for masks. However, I can see light through the gaps in the threads, so that makes me a bit uneasy. Also, these masks don't have a nose wire, so I will probably add them myself. The masks are very comfortable.I appreciate the 3 layers and softness and the fact that these, like I said, pass the flame test. Overall, I'm fairly happy with them. However, if you're wanting the best possible protection, I recommend buying cotton masks with a filter layer from Etsy :)

  I measured my face as instructed and was well within the LARGE size requirements (4.5""-5.75""). I measured 5.25"".  From the reviews and comments I thought I was ordering the correct size as both my wife and I fell within the large range and we could share them.  When they arrived they were more child-sized. When they are on if you open your mouth the mask pulls down off your nose. The ear stretch rings are way too thin, flimsy and stretchy and do not hold mask in place very well. If I would purchase the x-large they would undoubtedly not fit my wife.

  The other reviewers were right, this is the best mask. I have masks from Etsy sellers, family-made masks, disposable, various other commercially-made cloth masks. These are by far the most comfortable. The material is really soft and light-feeling but is sturdy and thick. The bands do not bend my ears forward or hurt at all. They're not the typical elastic material. I've worn these masks for an 8 hr shift with no issues. The large size fits me, but were too big for my 13yr old. I would definitely buy again, and have recommended them to family.

  Initially I liked this mask because it has a larger coverage area, it is soft, smells good and  is breathable the ear loops are much more comfortable than my previous mask.  My only problem is because it is a bit large and the material is a bit slippery it moves alot - especially when I look down or turn my head.  Unfortunately the mask slides up and touches my eyes or even covers my eyes and I have to keep adjusting it over and over which is a pain.  I tried twisting the strings for the ear loops to make it tighter but it puckers at the sides and creates a slight opening thus it doesn't sit flat on my face.  I will either have to find something to tighten the ear loops from behind the ear so the mask doesn't move so much or give them to my husband to try as he is a larger guy and they might fit him better than me.

I really desperately wanted to love these as a replacement for the wasteful surgical masks, but, I CAN SEE LIGHT THRU THESE ?!?!?

  I just got these face masks today. I put one on and was a little disappointed. The face mask is very comfortable and light. The material feels very good. I was disappointed, however, as the fit is not tight. The mask does not have a nose wire as N95 and many other masks do. The fit on my nose was very light. I could feel my breathing coming out thru the top of the mask. When I inhale I could inhale particles thru the top of the face mask as well. Not very reassuring. If they had a nose wire I could get a tighter fit. UPDATE: I have been trying to fix the no nose wire thing to make it fit better and I just realized that the mask will not offer COVID-19 protection as it seems to allow small particles like COVID19 thru. I simply cannot recommend these masks and I will not be using them.

  Purchased this product with my money. You get 3 black masks.  I am very pleased  with this product.  I didn’t go with the suggested sizes offered on the chat. I sized down. According to the chat for 5 inches in length you should get large but I went with medium and it worked well for me and my husband. The mask 😷 is comfortable, light and allow you to breath easily.  It covers very well your nose and mouth and the elastic is it’s right not lose or stiff. I love the fact that if one day I decide to wear makeup is not going to show stains because the inside is in black fabric. Yes that is a plus for ladies.  The little brochure with instructions about care is very helpful.  In my opinion little expensive.  Finally, I hope  the quality of the product stay there for a while.

  Very satisfied with my purchase. It fits very well and very comfortable. Easy to put on and very soft to the skin as advertised. My wife put hers on and she said at first she felt it would fall off when she talked., but after a wash in the laundry, it fixed that. I guess the wash shrunk it a little. either that or it was the dryer. So if you don't want yours to shrink, don't put it in the dryer. Our mask didn't shrink that much. I would definitely recommend it and I'll be purchasing some more just so I can wear clean ones while I wash the first ones.

  First off, it should be noted that I’ve gone thru well over 20 different masks before purchasing this one.I’m 250 lbs, 6’ tall and wear a size 7 1/4 cap (if that means anything) and I can say that this mask (XL) fits me very comfortably. I have a big head and wear glasses and this mask covers my whole face, even under my neck, and it does not tug on my ears. Lastly, the mask covers the bridge of my nose and I’m able to rest my glasses right over the mask to prevent any fogging. I highly recommend this mask!

  I wear face masks daily if there even a chance I will be out in public or interact with anyone.  This mask is the most comfortable I've worn.  It fits very nicely on me and it's soft.  It doesn't shift around while doing my daily work activities.  The straps are surprisingly sturdy and don't seem to want to break without some intentional effort to do so.I would have to say that paper masks seem slightly less inclined to build up what I call breath humidity within it  but I would expect that from any cloth mask.  However, cloth masks like this one will be more effective in reducing the possibility of being exposed to something or preventing someone from being exposed to anything I am potentially carrying.

  The seller is dedicated and accountable in making sure you are happy and satisfied with their product.  I ordered their suggested one size up face masks, soon they sent me a follow up email to make sure I'm ok with them.  The face masks are comfortable, easy to wear, but the only issue was the coverage around the nose's curvature areas beneath eyes were not tightly sealed due to slight slip during breathing, so I figured medium was likely the right size to solve this.  Soon, the seller sent me a new order in medium without hassle of sending the ones that I already have in hand, and the mediums do cover my nose more securely.I highly recommend this seller for their extreme dedication, accountability and the comfort of their products!

It has enough breathability so that claustrophobia doesn't set in and when my child tried it on he just shrugged and said"" that's comfy."" So there you have it.

  I was disappointed to find that there is no wire at the top of the mask. This is important to shape it to your nose to get a tight seal and keep your glasses from fogging up under certain conditions.  But Ile try using it anyway. At least it was more affordable than most.  The three pack means I can give two to others.. I have straightened out a paper clip and worked it into the seam over the nose and then shaped it to my nose . This is an improvement that is needed!

My son is using these for school, he’s in Jr. High, and his face is not getting irritated during the day.  He says they are cool, he doesn’t get hot in these, and he is picky and temperamental about being hot!  My husband likes them too so I ordered more sets for us to use.  They wash well and are definitely worth the money!  Also, I don’t put these in the dryer, I let them air dry, based on the recommendation that came with these masks.  I would love it if they would come in additional colors, particularly since the schools in my area are only allowing solid masks!

  I have a huge head (hat size is 8-1/2), so I studied on this for two weeks (I know, I am OCD), and finally settled on this model because they offered extra-large size. I wish I knew two months ago that my whole mask-finding issue was only about getting a man-size. This mask is PERFECT! (you get three for eighteen bucks). It slips right onto my face, spaced perfectly between the bridge of my nose and under my chin; the elastic loops are strong and stretchy. It never slips, it never squashes me or tugs on anything - very comfy! It's a very good barrier for me, yet also so breathable that when a gentle breeze poofs my way I actually feel the breeze on my face through the mask. I love this mask!!!

Once we are back at home, we wash them instantly using hand soap like we wash hands (to ensure - safety). So, far the quality is pretty good, elastic still holding its initial strength, and doesn't suffocate it either. Recommended for purchase..I have added pics to understand dimensions.

  Because of what is going on in the world, we have all had to acclimate to a new way of life. Having Asthma, I was worried about what type of masks would not make me feel anxious about being able to get full breaths. I feel completely at ease wearing this everywhere. I honestly forget I have it on sometimes, and that is absolutely unheard of for someone like me. They did a great job with the fitting of the mask, with just enough room to where you don't feel you are sucking in fabric, starting the cycle of anxiety of not being able to breathe. I would recommend this mask to anyone, breathing issues or not. Take care everyone and stay safe.

I would recommend this mask to anyone, breathing issues or not. Take care everyone and stay safe.

  This face mask is from Viet Nam and is well constructed and finished (unlike so many other masks from all over that are sloppy and poorly sewn). The Amazon webpage says it has a triple layer of fabric, which I can’t confirm, but will take their word for it. The fabric is fairly easy to breath through, is very soft, and dries fairly quickly after washing. One item is missing, though — there is no metal nose wire for adjustment, so there is some exhaled leakage up into the eye area, which is not good, especially if you wear eyeglasses. If they would add a nose wire, I would give this mask a five star rating. Order fulfilment and shipment was very quick.

  Measured against my wife's homemade, 3 ply cotton with nose clip these just aren't competitive. I thought that homemade might not be good enough so bought these since they were very highly rated - as we learn this doesn't always mean that much given that most people will rate anything that doesn't fall apart immediately as at least four stars.In any case, these masks are two ply without a pocket to fit a filter.  Two ply makes them very breathable but then so is gauze. The knit makes them comfortable. However, they are hot and slip down since there is no nose clip and they fog up glasses as well. I threw them in my glove compartment in case I forget my homemade mask.

  Finally I've got a mask that fits my fat face!! I spent 10 dollars on a mask that looked like it was good quality but then after about 5 minutes my ears started to hurt and it didn't even cover my cheeks. BUT NOT WITH THESE ONES!These face masks are so soft and the covering actually covers up to just before your ears. The elastic bands that loop over your ears are very soft and somehow hold snug without pulling on the back of my ears.The fabric is super soft and surprisingly breathable. These were the first set of masks that I ordered on the internet and I'm thoroughly convinced that I lucked out with getting these ones rather than some of the other ones I considered.

  I FINALLY found a mask that I like! The ones I tried previously were either too small, too tight, or too uncomfortable. This mask has a comfortable fit, is soft, and breathable. The elastic is good and is neither too night nor too loose--just right! I ordered the XL size and it fits perfectly for me. The quality seems to be great and I think they have the potential to be long-lasting. great coverage on the nose, but no wire support for a tight fit on the bridge of the nose, but that is fine with me. I think it fits well without having any extra metal parts in it. Very well made and great-looking! When I put the mask on I mentally transform into a ninja warrior!

  I sweat a lot in the summer and had a real problem with masks getting sweaty. I specifically looked for 3-layer cloth masks that wick sweat away from your face. These did a pretty good job of that when we tried them on a couple of hikes. They don't retain sweat like does.  The material is very soft.  Like many cloth masks, I felt they stretched out slightly after several uses, but they reverted to size after being washed. The only thing I wish is that these masks had behind-the-head elastic as I feel masks like that fit me better. Wicking was a more important feature; so, I will be altering my masks with behind-the-ear elastic.

  These masks are fantastic! Since there are four (4) sizes — small, medium, large, and extra large — these masks can fit anyone. Buying the correct size makes a difference — so, you need to carefully consider the size chart provided with the listing before you make your purchase.There are NO smells for these masks other than the ones added by the user when the masks are washed; there were no odors when purchased either, but I washed the masks as directed by the manufacturer, before using the masks. So, my masks now have a fresh Tide fragrance.I have purchased several types of masks and, based on my comparisons of these masks to the others, I can state that these are the best. Although there are no metal nose pieces, you can buy self-adhesive metal nose pieces to add to the masks, if desired. These masks are soft and breathable, and they fit great: these masks are a perfect choice, and I highly recommend them.

HOWEVER, if you plan on working out with these you very well may struggle to breathe comfortably as it really traps all of your breath and has zero ventilation. Unfortunately, I'm still on the hunt for the perfect mask for working out. I'll keep these for shopping runs / walks etc..

  I’m required to wear a face covering while at work and prefer to wear one anytime I’m unable to properly socially distance. These EnerPlex face coverings are comfortable enough to wear all day long. They’re lightweight, yet substantial enough to make me feel well protected. I like the different size options available as well. I purchased the XL and they fit a larger size face well. The ear loops are very comfortable too! Hard to find that.I purchased 15 of these I liked them so well, and they delivered next day!!The only word of caution is they are a bit warm. But hey, with triple layer of protection I’m not sure how it wouldn’t be. In an indoor environment it’s not an issue.

  I have purchased the medium and XL sizes of these masks.  The XL fits my 13 year old son (who is man-sized), and the medium fits my 10 year old daughter.  We have struggled to find good-fitting, comfortable masks and feel like these are definitely some of the best.  There is some stretch to the mask especially up and down, and the material is soft.  I really appreciate the different size offerings, and the ear loops are the perfect size and stretch not to fall off or make you look like Dumbo.  If I could make any suggestions, it would be to offer in more fun patterns/colors, but really no complaints on these masks at all.

I had to double loop each side and basically cut off the circulation to my ears, to make it work. If it would've fit my face, I think I'd be a much bigger advocate.I'm not really sure which measurements are helpful... but I'm 5'10 and 170 lbs.

  I love these masks.  I am a petite adult female, and most of the masks I've tried have been too big for me, sagging and falling down off my nose, rendering them ineffective.  I've had to resort to tying the elastic ear bands to make them shorter.  Sometimes that results in my ""eating the mask"" as I try to talk with them on.  These masks are shaped in front to correctly fit over the nose and still allow talking.  The adult small/medium size fit me perfectly.  They are soft, wash well, and look good.  I like that they are three layers thick, for protection without bulk.

  I ordered the large size based on the metric they gave (measure from the bridge of my nose to my chin) and most reviews from adults said that a large worked. I received them promptly, washed them before use and right away they fit fine. About 10 minutes later they were sliding off my nose which I think is due to the ear straps. Maybe my ears are a little closer to my face than other people? Regardless, I contacted the seller and explained the situation. They emailed back within 24 hours and said they would send me a replacement order with mediums and I could keep or toss the larges (I gave them to a friend since they were great masks they just didn't fit me). I got the new order in a few days and they fit wonderfully! Great product and even better customer service! I highly recommend and would definitely buy again!

I hand washed the masks in cold water and allowed them to air dry before first use. The masks did not shrink or fade a lot of ink. I then customized them with iron on patches. I wore it all day from my car into the building (only allowed to take it off when eating in private lunch room) and no readjusting required.

  The XL is perfectly sized for a larger adult face.  The ear straps are stretchy, soft, and thin so they don't annoy your ears.  The curved shape of the mask makes space between your nose/mouth and the fabric so you can easily talk wearing the mask without it trying to walk its way downwards.  So far these are the best-fitting masks I've tried, and my go-to for a quick cover up since they're so easy to put on/take off.  The lightweight fabric helps, too, now that it's hot outside and wearing a heavy mask would be unthinkable in 100 degree heat.

  I followed the mask guide in the pictures, and the result fit really well.I noticed, especially when talking, that the mask sometimes slips below my nose. I inserted some metal wire into the hem of the mask over the nose bridge, to use as a nose clip. With that addition, these masks are perfect.The contoured shape at the top of the mask, with the nose clip, helps prevent fogging when wearing glasses (without the nose clip, not us much. Still better than other masks I've used, though).I've used several different masks since the beginning of the pandemic, and these are my absolute favorite.

  These masks are great. It’s the first of many I found that don’t suck into your face while breathing so it’s extremely breathable and doesn’t muffle your words at all. I’m an average size female so I ordered a medium which was just slightly too big as it slid down my nose but after one wash/dry they’re fantastic. These are also the first masks that don’t slip up into my eyes too— 100% the best I’ve tried, and I love it’s a multi-pack so I don’t have to plan when I do laundry because I’ll always have extra.

I wanted a wire to keep them close to my nose so that my glasses don't fog up, so I inserted some craft/jewelry wire in the seam around the nose, and now the fit tight and my glasses don't fog up!

  The only problem I have with this mask is that it does not fit snugly at the nose. Since I wear eyeglasses, my lenses are always fogging up making these masks more uncomfortable to wear than other masks that I own.

  This is the most comfortable mask I've tried.  It's three layers, very soft and breathable, and fits well.  Most important, the ear loops do not hurt my ears after extended wearing.It's been hot and humid here - with other masks my sunglasses fog up when I'm walking outside.  Not so with these.I highly recommend these masks.  Wonderful company, too.  I had an issue that needed to be resolved, and they went immediately above and beyond.I will definitely be buying more of these.

  We've accumulated a lot of masks looking for something better and also larger for my husband. This mask fits the bill . perfectly and they are so soft. They hand wash beautifully. The instructions say that it can be machine washed in cold water, but I have not done that, yet.  They come in smaller sizes as well. I recommend them. They were delivered very fast, which is not always the case with masks. ( I would really love it if they had the same fabric with a pouch for a filter, but that's another story.)

  Using the provided measurement guide I determined the Large mask would be the correct choice. I found them to be so small that they barely covered my face from the bridge of my nose to under my chin. The loops that go behind the ears are also too small which leads to the mask pulling uncomfortably forward on my ears. The material is so thick it is hard to breathe through the mask. In short, it fails to deliver all the things it promises to provide. A waste of money.

  The paper masks exacerbate my asthma.  I tried other cotton masks but they fit so tightly that each time a inhaled, some of the mask went in with my breath.  My glasses also fogged up.But these masks seem just right. I am a PSR and work at COVID-19 positive clinics so my mask must be comfortable enough to wear for an 8-hour shift.I recommend hand washing and air drying these masks before wearing them. Tiny black fibers came off in the wash-bowl and I  wouldn't want to have inhaled them.

  We purchased these for our son in the Army and he really likes them. Some days he has to wear it for his 12 hour shift. He said that while it gets warm like all masks do because of your hot breath, they are very comfortable and more breathable than his other masks. We decided to purchase the pack again for our other son who works at the local hardware store unloading trucks. He agreed that they are better than the other masks we had gotten. They are for adult faces and do not fit my teen girls as they are too big for them.

  These are very nice masks. I had been using the disposable ones and my husband was using a different cloth one. He said this one fit much better, was more comfortable around the ears and was very soft. At first, I thought that these would feel too heavy, but to my surprise, they were very lightweight and comfortable. I like the extra room around the mouth. It makes it easier to breathe and it is not as hot. I plan to decorate mine with sparkles. Will only handwash them to keep them in good shape.

  It's true your glasses do not steam up as much and the ear loops are soft and stretchy so your ears are much happier that most of the masks I've seen.  However, I do wonder if the porous nature of the fabric is a good thing.  One of the comment I've seem re the home made cotton mask is how porous the are.  Not a good thing for protecting outgoing or incoming.  In reading reviews one person that claimed he could blow a candle out with his mask on.  I didn't try it but I can well believe it.

  The product came sealed in a plastic package that had to be cut open which I like because it’s clean. Right out of the package one of the masks was ripping away from the seam. Each mask had different size ear loops which made for an inconsistent fit and resulting in the mask being loose and falling off my face. Other than that, the masks do seem soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, because of the poor quality and they don’t consistently fit I will be returning them.

  Comfortable and very breathable.  The seam allows for the fabric to bow away from the face so you're not constantly suffocating on a mouthful of fabric.  I purchased the large size, and they work well for both my fiancé and I (he has a GIANT head, and I have a cute little peanut head).  Also, the asymmetrical cut allows for you to ""choose your own adventure"" when it comes to fit, which I love.  All in all, the best face masks I've come across so far.  Will definitely purchase again if the need arises.

I do not have this problem with masks that have an adjustable nose clip.EDIT: I was contacted by the manufacturer after posting my review and offered a refund or replacement.  I choose a refund.

  I’m a thin, adult woman and the youth/adult medium fits me very well. Be sure to wear the mask high enough on your nose. The bottom of the mask will hug the lower jawline. The first time I wore the mask I had it too low on my nose and I felt pressure, since my nose wasn’t positioned into the nose “pocket”. Very nice material and well stitched. I live in hot, humid Florida, and the Black mask is not too hot.

  These are nice and soft.  The ability to order sizes means that ear comfort/coverage can be matched to face size so that is mighty nice - I got large which fit just right on my fat head without excessive tugging at the ears.  The reason I'm only giving three stars is that they are the warmest mask I've tried thus far and that is saying something.  I wouldn't want to wear one for a long time.  However, as a backup that's easy to keep in the pocket, they are nice.

These hit the mark, only issue is when I went to order more and added the Blue Small size, they came in and it was definitely alot bigger than the White ones. It was actually the same size as mine that I ordered in Black Medium. Vendor needs to update sizing or ship correct sizes when ordered.

  Great mask, doesn't hurt behind ears, a perfect fit on the face without needing a metal piece to keep on the nose. I wore it all day without it creeping off my nose once. It is a little thick but very comfortable, 3 layers..I checked... washes and dries without any issues. It also passed the candle test. I liked them so much (as far as anyone can actually like a mask) I bought 3 packages and they all were the same, no deviations of shape as some others mentioned.

  The size is maybe a tiny bit larger than expected, but basically near perfect, and the bands don’t hurt your ears at all if that’s an issue you’re worried about. It is shocking how easy it is to breathe with the mask on, and in general everything works just as advertised. I was skeptical due to the lack of a metal wire on the nose, but the mask is shaped so that there is no issue, and not having that metal wire makes it a lot more comfortable anyways.

  These are very nice face masks.  They're comfortable, lightweight, fit well and breathable.  I will likely be ordering more in the very near future.  So far I have only hand washed them so I don't know how well they would actually hold up in the washing machine but I don't expect that to be a problem, especially if they are washed in a laundry bag.  The only thing I could think of that would possibly make them better would be to have an adjustable nose piece.

  I have worn this mask for a week now and it has been just what I wanted/needed and everything was as advertised. I measured my face, as recommended, and at 4.50 I decided on the Large (I think the Medium/Youth might have been pushing it too much in the snug department) and it fits like a glove. Soft material and very comfortable. 3-Ply thick so I feel safe. I ordered blue and even got nice compliments on the color so that was a bonus.

  I like this mask. I bought it as an alternate from my professional mask to use when necessary to go out in public like the grocery store, etc. It's lightweight and easy enough to wear. I like that it is machine washable and, I like the solid black that can be worn with nearly any color.

  I like this mask. I bought it as an alternate from my professional mask to use when necessary to go out in public like the grocery store, etc. It's lightweight and easy enough to wear. I like that it is machine washable and, I like the solid black that can be worn with nearly any color.

  I needed a mask that could be washed.  I kept re-using the ones I'd get from doctor visits and hair appt visits.  I hear that isn't healthy.  So, these were perfect for my needs.  They are soft, comfortable, and I love that the point sticks out and doesn't touch my lips.  I don't see much makeup rub off on it at all.  I gave one to my son and he seems to like it.  I keep one in my purse, and an extra in my car.  Great quality so far!

  These masks are the best I've had so far. They fit like a glove and I can actually breathe comfortably with it on. Got the large for me and the small for my 4 yo. It fit him well also. Stays on while holding a conversation. I don't constantly have to keep readjusting. Good product.

  Awesome mask!  Fit/ shaped around nose and jaw really well.  Two people have asked me where I got them since they look good and don’t budge as I talk.  I’m female, 5’4, 135 lbs and bought medium.  Fits me perfect and my 12 yr old AND my husband who is 5’10, 145lbs.  Had bought large for him but they just fell off his nose.  Ear tabs are comfortable AND thin so don’t make my ears stick out.Bought 3 more sets so my kid can wear them to school

  Despite the good reviews I was skeptical based on my other mask experiences. Well, I'm very happy with these masks. Very soft, seem sturdy, and fit very well (tight to face/no gaps). I find these easier to breathe through with minimal fogging vs. other masks I've purchased. I bought the XL since I'm a big dude and these are sized just about perfectly. Ear bands don't stretch too much, but that makes them more comfortable to me since less pull-back on the ears. Very lightweight and comfortable--i.e. all around very well made.

  I got these because large size masks can't handle the power of my Jay Leno chin. Unfortunately, they're just a little too big for my head. The loops hang loose on my ears, leaving coverage gaps at the cheeks and chin. The real killer is the nose area. Since the masks have no metal former at the nose, it also leaves plenty of room for air to pass there as well. I can't fault the comfort of the fabric, but without that metal former, I can't recommend these masks even for people with more prodigious noggins than my own. Wearing a mask without a nose strip is tantamount to not wearing a mask at all, y'all!

  After many failed attempts at finding a mask that was large enough, that wasn't too hot and didn't pull on my ears, I finally found it with these.Pros: They are larger than anything I've seen so far in this style of mask. They pass the candle test yet feel breathable. There is virtually no strain on my ears from the loops and the mask fits snugly enough.Cons: Fogs glasses, I wish they had a nose bridge piece. They might be too big for some, but I was looking for big and comfortable.

  The material is thin nylon. The purpose of the mask is to keep you from infecting others in many states it is mandatory in public places. It will fulfill the letter of the law for the mandatory mask decree but does not fulfill the purpose. The packaging stated to wash before first use and a lot of dye came out in the wash and now I have a bajillion stone grey socks.  Finally, the ear loops are small and pull my ears forward. You will look like a howdy doody bank robber but you will be in compliance.

  I orderd a package of the small for my children, 8 year old boy who is on the smaller side and a 5 year old girl who is above average for her age. The masks fit neither. Just sitting still they would fall down and expose their nose and mouth completely and they were too large for their faces.  They fit my wife just fine (5'3"" 120). The label on the package states size small but possibly that is not what was placed in the package.

They don’t move off your nose as you speak as other masks might, and it doesn’t feel like you’re eating them when breathing in, or like a balloon when you breathe out.  I have an average built face, and the large fit perfectly, and amply covers my nose and mouth.  Can’t wait for all this COVID crap to be done, but in the meantime, this mask will be comfortable.

  The worst thing about wearing a mask all day at work is the humidity and sweat from hot breath. This thing is really thick, like 2 or 3 layers, like a little pillow, and that means it's hot! Probably fine if you just wear a mask for 30 minutes.

I went out on a limb and bought these and got him the size SMALL and I'm glad I did! They fit him perfectly! Not to mention he loves the color of them too he said he feels like a ninja! With kids returning back to school, this is a scary time (thanks COVID-19) at least I know my son will be protected.

  I've been using regular size disposable masks with no problems with the fit. I bought this mask in XL because I have a short beard and thought it would fit better over my chin. It did fit over my beard, but the ear straps were much too tight and uncomfortable even when it wasn't over my chin. They actually pulled my ears forward! Length may be XL but the width of the ear straps is not. I'm returning this item and will get one with adjustable ear straps.

  I purchased these masks because they come in a variety of sizes. After referring to the sizing chart, I clearly fell into the middle of the size large masks. The primary issue I have is not the size of the mask on the face, but the stretch on the earloops. There isn't enough. The back of my ears are sore after just a short time with these masks on. I think the manufacturer should consider adjustable ear loops or ties. Otherwise, the fabric is nice and comfortable, and they hold up well to washing. Mixed feelings.

I ordered both a white set and a black set and they are the same way.  I will have to stitch in some colored thread to my masks.  Other than that, they are well made and fit comfortably.

  I the large mask (wear a 7/14 hat) and while it fits, I wish it was maybe 1/4 wider to take a tad more pull off my ears. I have to wear a mask for 0 hours a day so maybe I should get one of the behind the head bands.  The only real complaints I have is I wish they had a bendable nose strip, to reduce my glasses fogging up and they are noticeably warmer than the disposables I was wearing.  Overall they look nice and seam to be well constructed.

  I'm a normal size guy but some say I have a big head; hah.  These do fit and are comfortable across nose, under chin, and around ears.  A downside is that there is no stiffener across bridge of nose so big gaps appear there; fogs goggles, glasses, and safety glasses, as wells as letting in a lot of room air.  Ends up these are my go to masks, but am desperately pursuing some fix for the nose gaps.

  These are great. Very soft and comfortable. They are breathable but also pass the “candle test”. I was wearing disposable masks but these are so much better. You can actually wear these at work all day and still be comfortable.I also wear glasses and have had minimal fogging with them.Can’t recommend these enough. Great balance of comfort, style, and safety.

They're light weight and you can actually breath with them on. They do have multiple layers and are water resistant so they do offer protection from any sort of pandemic the democrats work up!

  Few of us like wearing masks all the time, and I was one who dreaded it. After trying several masks that made me feel smothered, or which pulled my ears forward to where I felt like Dumbo, these finally fit the bill and are my go-to masks for everyday wear. I've washed them 5x and they have held up well so far. Large enough, comfortable, breathable, I am happy with how these work.

  These are very comfortable to wear but there is a gap either side of the nose so that when you exhale, the air blows up into your eyes.  I find this air flow very uncomfortable.  Also the material is mostly polyester even though the ad says ""cotton blend"" (which is technically correct) it's mostly polyester.

  I bought these masks for my boyfriend to wear at work. He really enjoys them! I wore one the other day when I forgot my mask, and I'm thinking about purchasing some more for myself. They are definitely a bit warmer than some masks, but that gives me the feeling that they are a bit thicker. He enjoys the fact that they are black since he does mechanic work, and they often get dirty throughout the day. They fit nicely against our faces.

  I have worn this mask for almost two weeks and they wear well. The mask is soft and comfortable. Because I have a small face I bought the medium size. The medium size looks very small but it fit my face well but if I were to order this mask again I would order the large size so I would have just a little more room. A person with an average size face should buy the large size mask. They wash well by hand and dry quickly. Good deal for the price.

  These are great masks! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I bought the Lg size expecting them to fit my husbands normal sized head. The sizing seems to run small. It covers his face, but only if he doesn’t talk. When he talks it either pops off his chin or his nose. I would but these again, but would size up. Very comfortable and easy to breathe in.

  These masks are SOFT and large enough not to pull at my husband's ears all day.  There's not a nose wire, but that didn't do much to prevent glasses fogging in other masks, so it's okay.  Anti-fog spray helps with that.  I may put a frame in these, since they're so soft that they do pull in at every inhalation, but again, still beats an ill fitting mask.

I really like the sizing options - the large size worked great for my huge face.  The straps are pretty substantial with good elastic.  I like the way the mask is cut, a little higher over the nose.  It doesn't creep down when you talk, which was a problem with cheaper masks.  I liked these so much I bought a second set.

  First mask I have found finally that fits my face.  I don’t have a extra large head but for some reason all the masks I have purchased would barley fit over both my mouth and nose. And if I spoke it would pop off up or down. These fit beautifully!  Stays on when I am talking and it is super soft and breaths beautifully. Very comfortable for long term use. Love it.

  After some research, I went with these masks because of their good reviews on Amazon. I bought two of these 3 packs and got them in size Large. They fit perfectly and are very breathable for masks and have a nice material. These are perfect for wearing around my college campus this semester. The outside of the mask is very water resistant.

  These masks fit well and luckily are not too hot. I was concerned because they are black. However, they are thin and do not have a pouch for a filter.  So don’t feel overly secure about their level of protection.

  My fiance had a hard time finding a mask that would work for him. Most masks are way too small for him, particularly right now when he is sporting a large mountain man-esque quarantine beard. I bought him these after reading in the reviews that they work well for men with large heads and beards. The reviews were true - my fiance thinks they are very comfortable, soft, and finally the right size for him!

  Very comfortable.  Good coverage, both horizontally and vertically.  For comparison, I've included a photo of this mask (the black one) and a Hanes ""one size fits most"" mask I bought at the store (the white one).  Note the Hanes mask leaves space alongside my cheek, and pulls my ears down.  These masks are much more comfortable with better coverage.

  I have a melon head, so I may be somewhat unique.  The material is soft, it seems to be very well made, the height is perfect, but the width seems narrow, to the point it is somewhat difficult to stretch over my ears.  Sizing is by height (bridge of nose to chin), but it seems they should factor in the width as well.  Again, it may be because I have a large head.  I do recommend this product

  These masks fit my 99 yr old mom very well and are very easy to take care of.  Just toss them in a small net bag and đrop them in the washer.  I air dry these on a towel rack.  Mom has a small face and the average disposable masks are too big and the kid size ones are too small.  At least these masks she only adjusts once when she first puts it on.  With the others she's always pulling on them.

  Very comfortable face mask - I had been looking for a larger mask and the XL size was just what I was looking for.  The ear loops were not tight enough but that was fixed by tying a knot in each to make them shorter.  Biggest concern was that the fabric was not as advertised - it was supposed be one outer layer of polyester and two inner layers of cotton.  But the two inner layers were both poly / cotton blend.  It makes the mask hotter to wear.  I am going to keep them and wear them but I was disappointed at that.

The material is breathable and able to be washed in the washing machine.

  The masks are smaller than we expected.

The elastic around the ears is thin but it doesn't pull too tight so it is comfortable for long periods.  It isn't an extra large, I'd call if a large.  I am 6'2"" with a full (trimmed) beard and it fits perfect.

  I liked that I was able to choose the size, but as an adult with an average size head (I guess) the large masks felt a little loose. With that said, I was able to breathe more easily than a surgical disposable mask when I was active. The only downside is that I felt the need to periodically adjust the mask as it kept slipping down.

  These run small. I’m adult and ordered medium. I think most adults would need a large or XL  because the small is better for youth and fits so tight there’s very little room to breathe and makes mask hot. Measure carefully and err on the next size up.  They do use a comfy material. I’m giving mine away. Too tight.

  I measured over the 6"" for an XL mask when I put it on it was small, talking normally the mask started to pull off my nose, no matter what the mask kept getting pulled below my nose.  So I will have to pass these on to those in my family with a smaller face LOL.  Everything else though is great, very comfortable although I think the thickness of the mask may pose an issue in the hot sun.  Also no nose adjustment piece so there may be a lot of fogging up of glasses.

  I have tried a variety of masks and this one has been the best so far in terms of fit and comfort. Bought a size large and it fits myself (female) and teen son. We both have a narrow face with a bigger nose. These masks do not squish our noses or slip off our faces, nor does the elastic pull behind the ears. They seem a little flimsy so not sure how well they will hold up to multiple washes, but for the price and comfort they're still a good value. For reference, we both measure 5"" from the bridge of nose to bottom of chin.

  I don’t recommend these masks to anyone. Mind you, I have an average sized, adult face. They fit so loosely near my nose and kept falling downwards as I talk. The whole purpose of wearing a face mask is to protect your nose and mouth from droplets ... these are not worth it and I highly recommend buying elsewhere.

  I would have rated it a full 5 stars except that it said ""wash before using"" and I was desperate.  I had a doctor's appointment which required me to wear a mask and I had run out of my disposable ones ... so, I wore the new mask without washing it first.  So, I have no idea how well it will hold up to the washing process.

  I’m an adult female with a small face and I have had a hard time finding masks that actually fit well. The medium size has been perfect for me. They are soft, breathable and offer good protection. It’s easy to launder as well. Definitely happy with this purchase and plan to order more in the future!

  My S.O. has a regular sized face with a beard. It seems like some masks are sized towards smaller or female faces. Everytime he would put a mask on I'd have to hide my laughter because his ears would be pulled forward and he looked like Shrek.  Thankfully these masks are sized right and comfortable for me too.

  Any mask over your nose and mouth feels restrictive and gets stuffy after a while.  I like this mask because it gives extra room in front of your nose and mouth for a little air pocket.  Also, it is very comfortable over the ears and over the face, and it is made with 3 layers so I feel it is better than the single layer ""designer"" type masks that are out there with cute pictures on them.

I wear glasses with it just fine, and they don't steam up -- at least not here in Arizona.  I wash the masks by hand in cold water after using, squeeze them out, and hang them up to air-dry.

  The material is soft and the elastic ear loops are of good length. There is no bendy bit for a nose, but that is clear enough before ordering.  However, like all such masks, these are hot.

  They’re not too thick for easy of breathing.  Not much difference between the extra large and a large size.  The small size was too big for my eight-year-old.  The medium fit my 11-year-old.  I wish they made an extra small size for those extra small faces. Overall good quality.  They did shrink slightly in the wash, would recommend hair drying.

  Got it because black it goes with everything. I have a thin face (not skinny) but sleek. Fits ok, mask keeps sliding towards my eyes and I have to keep adjusting it. Not good to keep touching your mask to adjust then sanitize your hands again and again. May get medium next time.

  These are the best facemaska that I own. The material is very breathable from the inside but thick enough to offer sufficient protection. They stretch even after several wash and dry cycles and the ear loops are comfy and don't bother my ears at all. Highly recommend.

  This is a good, comfortable mask. It's thick but not too thick and fit well. It does get a little warm, but to me that's more a testament to the effectiveness of the product than a detractor. As a nurse, I've worn many disposable masks in this style and found this mask to be much nicer to wear.

I hand washed & hung dry. They dry quickly. The only drawback is that without the wire part on the top, it is not as secure a seal & my glasses fog up sometimes.

I was looking for a high quality, simple and washable mask and this set was excellent.  The XL size is perfect for adults.

  I have purchased several types of masks during COVID.  These are definitely  my mask of choice. These are comfortable, light weight and fit my face very well. The material is soft and conforming to me face. I bought a package to try out, and ordered another set immediately.  I highly recommend this item.

  This is the first mask that is a good fit for my 7 year old daughter.  I’m not thrilled that they are only available in white (dirty easily) but they are a great fit.  She is rather petite for her age, but I wouldn’t say she is overly small.

  Decent product. Pretty soft and comfortable. Also holds up well in the laundry. There is nothing at the top of the mask to secure it on the top of your nose, though; so I do have to pull it up quite a bit. I would suggest the maker add some sort of metal strip to help keep it secure.

  I didn't want to take a chance with unisex sizes so I went with the large,  fit perfectly. These fit great for my normal sized head at 5'11 200lbs. They do hold in moisture if it's hot out, but for temporary use in and out of stores around town, they work great. I like that they don't press up against the mouth so you can take easily with them.

  Opened the package and found nothing inside. Every option for replacement requires sending the nonexistant items back. Since I needed masks and these are the only XL sized ones I could find, I took a chance and ordered again. Fortunately the second order did arrive. Not happy about having to pay twice, but the masks are roomier and more comfortable than others I have used. Would buy again when these wear out - hopefully I won't have to order and pay twice again.

  Breathability was good, and size was good in that it didn't cover half the face.  Ordered a small so the bands began hurting around the ears after a couple of hours.  Will order again in a medium.  The small fit a medium sized teenage boy except for the ears.

  Mask is soft and comfortable but it falls off my nose when I talk. I guess you could say it’s too small for my face even though it’s L/XL. This mask might be more appropriate for women and children.

  I ordered these masks in a size 'S' (3 - 9 yrs old) for my 5 yr old daughter.  They fit her really well.I was a little concerned at first because there isn't a metal adjustable piece in the nose area, but that didn't matter.  These masks are contoured just right and the adjustable metal piece isn't even needed.My daughter is happy that she finally has some masks that fit her well.  She's petite, and w/also being a child, it was hard to get the disposable face masks to stay on her well.I do notice that these masks need to be put on the right way.  There is a top and bottom, but it's not as easy to tell.  The top is slightly more pointy.  I'm going to take some fabric paint and mark near the top, so that my daughter knows which end to put over her nose.Overall these masks fit well, are comfortable,  and my kid can breathe easily.The only thing is that these fit my 5 yr old really well (w/a little room to grow) and she is petite.  She wears size 4T still and can actually still fit in some 3T things as well.  I'm not sure how well these would fit an 8 or 9 yr old.  I know the range for a size SMALL is listed for 3 - 9 yrs old, but there can be quite a variation in face/head sizes with in that broad range.  I would probably go to the next size up if getting these for a 9 yr old.

  For the past few months, with the introduction of our global pandemic, I have been ordering a wide array of different makes/brands of face masks.  Masks made of cloth are always my top choice as most seem to have multiple layers of protection and they can be washed and re-used.As you are probably aware, not all cloth masks are alike.  I have purchased some that were so thin I immediately returned them to the manufacturer.  It is absolutely necessary that the masks I wear are well made and several layers thick.This mask from EnerPlex falls in line with the very best cloth masks I have used.The cloth is nice and thick.  It contours around the face nicely and the straps that go around the ears are equally well made so the mask does a terrific job of hugging the chin.  I wore one of the masks today as I visited a local market and I was quite impressed at how well it stayed in place, not moving around or causing me to constantly readjust the position on my face.It's a very daunting position to have to consider what masks might be safe and what might not.  I can confidently tell you that this would be an excellent purchase.

  I'm reviewing the 3-pack version of these EnerPlex cloth face masks.  I received the large size.These are fairly comfortable cloth face masks with elastic bands that go behind your ears.  The nose area has extra cloth that goes up your nose, but cuts away in swoops so the fabric doesn't go near your eyes.  I was able to wear these masks during a whole work day, only taking them off intermittently to eat and drink and I didn't have any issues.  You can breathe and talk through the mask relatively easily.  The fact that I can breathe through the masks with no trouble is great, but I have no idea how effective that is at stopping airborne viral particles.  I have worn cloth masks that are thicker than these and harder to breathe through than these, so I just don't know how effective they are.  However, I think they have to be somewhat on par with simple surgical masks.  But unlike surgical masks, these cloth masks wash well in a washing machine and being that they are white, you can use some bleach if you really want to sterilize them.The only have two minor gripes.  The first is that while the extra nose fabric works pretty well, I still don't feel like I get a great seal around the sides of my nose.  It would really benefit from a thin wire sewn inside to help the top conform to your face and keep particles out.  I solved this problem with inexpensive adhesive metal strips that are also for sale on amazon.  The other minor gripe is that it's really hard to tell which side is supposed to be inside and which side is supposed to be the outside of the mask  based on the stitching.  I think I figured it out, but I really have to look at the mask for a couple seconds before I put it on.  Some more prominent stitching patterns or a single different thread color would have helped identify the inside versus the outside.Still, even with the minor gripes I do like these cloth masks and they are now in my weekly rotation of masks I wear to work and wash at the end of the day.

The first is that while the extra nose fabric works pretty well, I still don't feel like I get a great seal around the sides of my nose.  It would really benefit from a thin wire sewn inside to help the top conform to your face and keep particles out.  I solved this problem with inexpensive adhesive metal strips that are also for sale on amazon.  The other minor gripe is that it's really hard to tell which side is supposed to be inside and which side is supposed to be the outside of the mask  based on the stitching.  I think I figured it out, but I really have to look at the mask for a couple seconds before I put it on.  Some more prominent stitching patterns or a single different thread color would have helped identify the inside versus the outside.Still, even with the minor gripes I do like these cloth masks and they are now in my weekly rotation of masks I wear to work and wash at the end of the day.

  For someone like me who has issues with claustrophobia don't get this. I tried it on and I felt like I was gonna suffocate on the spot and had to remove it .Even though it's my favorite color black and I thought that's fine might like it make it used to it. No good for me it may work for other people but I've been working with the mental health therapist for years and she's trying to get me used to this mask stuff I find that the gaiter and  bandana ones work better for me than these ones these were too they felt kind of thick and I didn't care for that not easy to breathe through that's for sure.We don't really work well in the summer which is when I tried it I seem to make you very A lot harder than what year with the humidity too it's terrible. I didn't like these I'll let my husband try them but if he don't then I'll probably just re home then the somebody that can use them.

  There are some great points about this mask and then one that I don't love. I originally wanted masks with filters but thought I'd give these a shot because I like the shape of them. Honestly, I have purchased a few different masks It's always looking for that great fit and even without the metal piece in the top this fits very well. It is super comfortable, the most comfortable one I've tried yet. I like that it has the three layers of protection and an antimicrobial layer. I do wish it had an extra filter pocket but this seems to be fine. All of those points hit exactly where I wanted but, they're always has to be a rub.I can't wear these because of fog my glasses up terribly. I guess it really does take that metal nose piece to redirect your breath in order to not fog up your glasses. I do hate that because again, these are so incredibly comfortable and fit so well for my average size face. If I can figure out a workaround to get these to work I will totally wear them. This will be perfect for someone who doesn't have that problem.

  Very comfortable and accurately sized. My husband sent me back to purchase 3 more because he loves them so much and we like having extras on hand! I guess this officially makes me a repeat buyer! My husband is of average size (5’9 and 160 pounds) and the large for him fine. I also have a son and daughter who can wear the same size.Comfort is key these days with face coverings. The shape of the mask also helps prevent it from riding up to your eyes when you talk. Great price point - very fair for a 3-pack.  I wouldrecommend and I would purchase again.

  During this COVID-19 crisis, finding a mask that fits my 5-yo daughter's small face well has been a challenge. Thanks to companies like EnerPlex which makes multiple different sizes for adults, young adults, and kids, there is one less thing to worry about when we go out as a family (e.g., walking around the neighborhood, going to the park).We already own some adult-sized cotton masks from EnerPlex and these kid ones are made of the same material and exhibit the same excellent fit-and-finish and comfort. These masks also passed the ""water test,"" where we poured water on it to see if any water leaked through the material (it did not).Because my kid is on the petite side even for her age, the mask as-is was a bit loose on her. So we made small knots on each ear loop which improved the fit. This, however, caused some ear lobe discomfort after about an hour. We solved that problem by using a silicone mask extender (see pic).Overall, we're very happy with these kid face masks. The build quality is excellent, the fabric is soft and comfortable to wear and breathe through, and they're washable and reusable. It deserves a definite 5-star rating.

  I wear a mask at work and have been wearing cotton masks that are really hot. I was excited to give these a try. Compared to what I've been wearing, these are not nearly as hot but I also worry that they aren't filtering as well as the sturdier cotton masks. It's a give and take for sure. The fabric on these is soft and comfortable even if it feels a little thinner than some of the other masks I've tried. I got these in a large and they fit but probably would be too big for somebody with a small face. The ear loops are a comfortable soft elastic which and doesn't bother my ears even after wearing at work all day. However, I'm still happy when I get to take this off.I love that these come in a package of 3 so that I can keep one at work and one in may car for running errands. For those who work in close contact with others, I would probably recommend a mask with a filter but for running errands and at work on the computer, these masks work great.

  These masks are soft and comfortable.  These fit teen/youth and adult faces very well.I like the ear elastics because they don't rub.The mask fits great on my face and I really wish I could use them, but there isn't a metal strip on the bridge of the nose and I can't bend it around my nose.  This results in my glasses fogging up every time I exhale.Neither my son or I can wear these because we both have to wear our glasses.My 16 yr old daughter is using these because she doesn't wear glasses.  She loves these way better than her other fabric masks that she had.The masks wash up really easy.  Just toss them in the wash (the manufacturer recommends not using fabric softener) and hang to dry.Overall these masks are one of the more comfortable that I've worn, unfortunately my glasses fog up w/out a metal nose piece.

  Like a lot of us, I've been wearing face masks for about the past three or so months with the pandemic.  I've worn disposable masks, cotton masks from work (that don't fit great, and I'm guessing were cheap), some neoprene masks that I bought from Amazon, and now these.These are my favorite so far.  They fit soooo much better than the others do, at least on my face.  I ordered these in the medium size, and they fit great.  My measurement according to their size chart is 4"", which indicates a medium is the best, and it is for me.  They fit on me the way that they look on the people in the video, and they are more contoured to my face than the other masks that I've worn.  The ear loops have been comfortable to me, too, but I do have a narrower face that doesn't stretch out ear loops very much.I'd say that these are about as warm to wear as the disposable ""surgical"" masks, as well as the all-cotton ones that I happen to have (but there are so many designs, it won't apply to all of them).  They are significantly cooler than the neoprene ones, and they are less expensive.  I paid about $12/each for the neoprene ones, which do have a cotton interior layer, but those things just don't breathe well.These fog up my glasses like all of the others do.  Even the disposable ones with the metal nose piece fog up my glasses, and I find these to be more comfortable to wear.Honestly, I love these in almost every way.  I'd give these five stars if they didn't fog my glasses, and I almost gave them five stars anyway because they fit so well and are so comfortable, but I'm still holding out for finding a mask that's cool to wear and vents somewhere besides into my glasses.

  If you’re of taller than average height, with a proportional head, and have come to treat hats marked “one size fits all” as a sort of cruel joke, you’ll appreciate these masks. They’re a true XL, and easily cover my face from nose to chin. Quality-wise they’re very well done, with all seams and bordered bound and double stitched. The mask is three layers thick, with three different fabrics being used- a softer antimicrobial-treated poly/cotton  tricot for the layer next to your face, a heavier sort of Polyester jersey for the outer layer, and an inner layer of poly/cotton. These should last a long while and provide good protection for everyday use while shopping and working.

  EnerPlex Youth/Adult Small Size - Listed as Medium on the web pageI decided to go with a size a bit larger for my grandkids who range in age from 4 - 10.  This size is too large for the 4 yr. old, but we tie the earloops so the mask fits her face tighter.  She's active & the mask kept slipping off her nose.  They fit the older two better.I gave them all a bendable nose piece with adhesive on the back so the mask fits around the nose better w/o any gaps.  I'm sure a search will turn up DIY ideas on adding a nose piece to a purchased mask.I also like these ear loops which take up less room behind the ear & are soft,  comfortable.I also have this mask in X-Large which fits my hubby who has a beard.We like EnerPlex masks...they have 3 layers which is recommended; they're soft, cover the face nicely, have comfy earloops, are easy to breathe through & almost perfect in every way except they don't have a bendable nose piece.  I remedied that situation by purchasing a group of 100, self adhesive metal strips.  The only problem with those is they don't withstand many, if any, washings. One of these days, I'll add a small pouch to slip the nose piece in.. sewing it on would add tiny holes to the mask, and glue might make it too stiff when it dries. I'll practice w/glue on an old piece of fabric first.CARE: Wash before first use. Machine wash cold. Do not bleach. Do not dry clean. Tumble dry low or lay flat to dry to avoid shrinkage. No fabric softener

  Size XLFinally a 3 layer mask with a sizing chart.  These masks are soft, breathable & as comfy as a mask can be.  This fits my hubby who has a short beard. The mask goes far enough up on his nose that his glasses sit on the mask.  His bridge of nose to chin measurement is slightly over 5 1/2"" which falls in the upper end of the Large size.  I sized up to XL to make sure the mask fit over his beard.

  With masks being our new normal, it's becoming apparent that not all masks are created equal. I have a few ""fun"" masks that show my personality with double layers suitable for inserting filters. Those masks are fun to show off but not practical for wearing for long periods of time; the extra layer starts to make things stuffy and it's slightly heavier than these masks. I use the EnerPlex masks as my go to when I need to run a quick errand and don't care too much about appearance.These masks are flexible enough to wear for hours without getting a headache. The basic black color works perfectly and goes with everything. Best of all, they're light so if you need to exercise or work at a desk for long periods of time, this is the mask for you.

  Very comfortable and breathable masks, with good face coverage. The fabric that touches your face is soft. Washes well. No pull on the ears. It doesn't have adjustable features but fits well on my face. It doesn't feel too hot to wear in the summer. It's a great deal: you get a set of three for a bit less than $19.

  (Youth size) These are made with soft cotton, one of the more comfortable mask I've found on Amazon. That's important to make sure our kids can tolerate it. It's multilayered fabric, so it's thick enough to protect but not too stiff and doesn't suffocate. It's contoured to your face and nose, but it does not have a metal nose piece so it can gap open depending on the shape of your nose. May not be an issue since it's for kids. These are one of the better ones I've tried so far.

  These masks are well made and pass the candle test, so would be good for personal protection, provided you get them in the size that fits you.I checked the sizing guide before ordering and measured my face - I am in the ""adults with smaller faces"" category so I ordered a medium. It is too large for my face and while it fits well around the chin, it is too loose on top; it doesn't fit well my teenage daughters either. I offered these masks to my husband with a larger head/face, and it was too tight for him (the ear loops are not very soft or stretchy).I will keep these masks as a backup, but will continue the search for the mask that would fit me right.

  I've learned that I need a sewn-in seam for masks to fit my face well. That's why I really like this set of masks. The seam provides comfortable room for my nose and chin and wraps around my face well. I'd say I have a bigger head and there's a nice stretch to these masks that make them fit without pulling on my ears.The quality is good and all of the stitching is well-done. The fabric is nicely thick and has held up well after daily hand washings. I hand wash my masks as I'm washing my hands and then hang them to dry. So far, these are my favorite masks for daily use.

  I've been wanting kids face masks for quite sometime. I like that these are breathable and they initially fit well, until my daughter (5 years) started talking. Once she started talking her jaw pulled the face mask down her face. Maybe shes just a little too small for it and with time it will fit her better. Other than the fit not being perfect, I otherwise like the face mask.

Ordered these and overall pleased with the masks.What I Like:Quality cloth mask cut from one piece of material and seamed around the periphery. Has woven elastic ear pieces that are sewn to mask.  The overall construction is excellent.Comfortable to wear and not too restrictive. The ear straps do not pull too hard on your ears - about the most comfortable I have worn.What I Would Change:This is a bit pricey - should be perhaps 1/2 the price but a good quality mask nonetheless.Recommend!

  These are soft and fairly comfortable. I chose the size medium listed as for older children and small adults. The last time I order kids sizes they were tiny and way too small for my middle grade schoolers, so I was hopeful with these.They are too big, but ultimately we simply added slip knots to the nice stretchy, soft ear elastic and they worked great. It has been so hard to find masks for my kids that aren't really little kids, but aren't yet even small adult sized. With the minor adjustments we made these definitely worked.I think nineteen bucks for 3 masks might be a little high, but ultimately these provided what we needed and the kids like them just fine. So a solid 4 stars and I would recommend them.

  These masks fit and feel much better than the ""homemade"" masks that I purchased from Etsy.  And they are infinitely better than disposable masks.  They are very soft and have a great fit.  Except for the area on both sides of my nose by my cheek.  The mask doesn't sit against my face completely, but it's close.  Since the point of these masks is to reduce airborne fluids, they work just fine for that and I am happier with these masks than I was with any of the other ones I have had so far.

  I've tried more than a few different masks and most were a bit snug, these XL sized masks fit great.Wash them before your first useThey're much softer after the first wash. I ran them through the washing machine but let them air dry to avoid any shrinkageThey fit well, are well made and thicker than most of the cheaper masks I've used.Since these are thicker, you won't get the same air flow through them that you do with the thin masks. For normal day to day stuff like sitting at an office desk, walking around, they're fine...if you plan on doing any physical activities like working out, power walking or heavy lifting for more than a few minutes, you may want to find a thinner mask.

  These masks are large enough to fit big faces.  The fabric is soft and these masks are double layered.  The only downside is the lack of a filter pocket on the inside.  These are easy to wash though, so I guess you can get by without filters if you just wash them each day.  My boyfriend likes these a lot because he has problems with his sinuses and suffers from nasal polyps and these masks don't irritate his nose or limit his breathing as much as others he's tried.

  Things being what they are, I feel like I will be wearing a face cover for the foreseeable future. Not as big a deal for me, but my husband is kind of a big guy with, well, no other way to say it, a big head. He has struggled trying to find a comfortable fit for his face covers. I saw that these were XL, and immediately decided to try them.So they fit him so much better than a regular one size fits all mask. They aren't enormous or anything, just a little added extra that makes the mask much more comfortable to wear for him. They add about .5"" on either side of center.I like that they are washable and reusable. I would give these 5 stars if there was an insert for a filter.

  These are expensive (3 for $18.95), but they are much better than some other masks I've tried, as far as cloth ones. These are sewn so that they give you some space around your mouth and nose for breathing without sucking in the whole mask (I often feel suffocated). Lightweight and the fir is perfect for me--I have a normal sized face, as far as I can tell. These don't sag or fall off. I don't feel like I'm having to adjust the mask constantly. I wear a mask for at least 4 hours a day, sometimes more, at work in a bookstore, so comfort and breathing ability is important to me. These do the job.

  These masks are large and are washable. The fabric is a polyester blend so 'resists' water. That's a benefit because polyester does not saturate with liquid nor retain stains, so maybe can be kept cleaner. I especially like the shape: it has a raised part to cover more of the nose which helps to keep the nose covered when you're moving the jaw as when talking. The mask extends further out from the face with a small space between the mouth and the mask which contributes to making the mask more comfortable because less vapor pushes up out of the mask near the eyes.

  Ordered 5 different styles for my boys to wear to school.  These were their favorites (3 boys) and mine, too!  The medium fits my older elementary and myself perfectly and the large for my 14 and 16 year olds.  They liked them because the have a slight cone and stick ought just a bit to get off of their mouths!  So many masks have material bunched inside at the mouth that it’s hard to talk.  They also liked the comfortable ear loops and said they don’t slide down when talking.  I like them because they are 3 ply and the coverage is great over their faces for protection.  Will order more for sure!

They liked them because the have a slight cone and stick ought just a bit to get off of their mouths!  So many masks have material bunched inside at the mouth that it’s hard to talk.  They also liked the comfortable ear loops and said they don’t slide down when talking.  I like them because they are 3 ply and the coverage is great over their faces for protection.  Will order more for sure!

  These masks are very soft and comfortable to wear. This design that is higher at the nose tend to fit better around most people’s faces leaving less gaps. That being said, these masks are typical in being slightly restrictive to breath through as there are less gaps. I am wearing a medium and it fits perfect. The ear loops are comfortable and the material is very soft. It washes nicely and does not look wrinkled. I like that they offer 3 sizes as one size doesn’t fit everyone. They are reasonably priced for this level of comfort and quality.

  I got the medium size and fits me and my child, but definitely would not fit my husband. It is very soft and easy to breathe. it does get hot, it is not all cotton. There is no nose wire. The inside is white, outside is blue so they are easy to tell apart. Overall comfortable. They list XL size as 5.5 inches tall, and that would not fit my husband for sure, too. They need to make real XL size masks for sure.

  These masks are very solid and great to use during Covid 19.  I like to have an extra mask on me at all times, on the off chance they may rip or tear or break otherwise.  These are great for use while I work, or go to the store.  Very comfortable and easy to clean.  I have no terrible issues with breathing while using these.  These are a great option should you need a main or spare mask during the pandemic.

  These masks are very easy to put on and take off. Previously I was using ones with the elastic that goes all the way around the head, and those were very uncomfortable and difficult to put on, not to mention totally messed up my hair every time. These are much easier especially when you are taking on/off repeatedly, like when out running errands. These I could even wear to the salon!

  These masks are thick and soft. I have worn them for short periods of time but in the heat they become hot a little quicker than I would like. The entire mask is soft and the youth medium fit my large adult head well. I think they may run a bit big as I expected these to be to small for an adult. In cooler weather they seem like they would be perfect and very protective.

  These masks are very soft, but not fluffy. They provide an unexpectedly good fit. \I would have loved them even more if they had a pocket inside.One caveat: I ordered two sizes (L and XL). Both fit me great, and the difference is just about half inch from top to bottom. In other words, at least for these two sizes there is very little difference.

Sometimes they fog up with glasses. It seems like that's unavoidable unless you have an N95 mask with a tight seal. These work well for our family's needs.

  These masks are very soft. Since they are multi-layered, they may be thicker than some other cloth masks available, but they are still breathable and incredibly comfortable.I was a bit bummed when the masks I ordered were a too small for my face, but I was pleasantly surprised when the company reached out after delivery to make sure everything was to my satisfaction. I let them know they were a bit small, and they remedied the situation immediately.Highly recommended.

  These masks are well constructed and fit nicely on the face, they have that curve around the nose to make them fall a little better around the nose. They don't feel too tight or pull my ears forward.They're double lined which is nice but they're also made of a synthetic material which is NOT very breathable. I don't mean I can't breathe, I still can, my face just gets very hot and uncomfortable pretty quickly while wearing this. They're just not the nicest to wear. I've noticed cotton masks are a lot more comfortable to have on, especially on hot days.

  I've bought too many masks and wasted too much money over the past few months to finally find a mask that 1) doesn't fog my glasses, 2) fits comfortably on my face (no pulling of the ears or ""tight"" feeling), and can be reused.I washed it first (ALWAYS wash any clothes before wearing them), put them out to dry so they didn't shrink in the dryer, and felt great. I know a surgical mask will protect more against particles, but they fog my glasses which isn't helpful since I can't go without my glasses (and yes I've tried all the ""tricks""), but this cloth is thick, yet breathable.My only regret was getting black instead of white because it's hot outside, but I'm still gonna wear them because they fit perfectly! If you have a big head, wear glasses (or both), I'd absolutely recommend these. They come in a pack of three, and I gave one to my friend because he had the same issues.

I just throw them in with my laundry (cold wash), air dry them, and they are set. So convenient!

  This is my third mask, and the first that actually fits.  I'm a big guy, and I have a beard, so the average masks I tried before did not fit well at all.Also, this mask is very soft and breathable.  It's hard to know how much the ""breathability"" reduces the protection it provides.The one negative I'll mention is that this mask does not have an aluminum strip to make it fit against one's nose, so it tends to fog up glasses.

  WOW! I'm really impressed with these masks. They're very comfortable, the material is really soft on your face. They look good (as good as a mask can look lol) and most importantly, they work VERY well! I did a match test as soon as they came in. Basically i lit a match, held it right in front of the mask and blew hard in an attempt to blow out the match. I did this 3 times, and 3 times I wasn't able to blow the match out! I immediately bought 2 more sets, one for my Mom and one for my Dad. They fit as the sizing chart says, and they confom nicely to your nose!

  These is how a PPE mask should be. Is very comfortable and breathable. The material is soft and I could wear it all day due to the fact that I know it will help and protect me during this time . I meets the CDC requirements that how a mask should be used and build for. The 3 layers protection is great and I did a wet test and truly shows the waterproof on the outer layer how it stops the particles and it least it will stop droplets of someone coughing.  High quality indeed and I recommend.

  Hi AllI have been having trouble finding a good quality comfortable mask for my big face/head. After numerous orders on amazing, I finally found one that fits comfortably, especially around my ears. It also does not pull my ears and doesn't fog up my glasses up to much. Slightly warm however I am not used to wearing a mask. I have been wearing it for over an hour now while working at home and at times forgot I was wearing it when trying to slip my coffee!I ordered the XL

  I am a server on a hot patio so having a good mask that can stand up to daily washing is essential. My primary issues with masks so far are that they don't breathe, they irritate the skin, and they're plain too large/loose for my face. I'm 5'3"" and 120lbs for reference to my size. I find these fit great, they don't irritate my ears and they wash well (by hand.) When sweating a lot, the mask did irritate my face and sometimes gets caught in the mouth of the wearer, but what can you do.

  These are by far the softest and most comfortable fabric masks I have tried. The interior is very soft and they are lightweight enough that I can keep one on for an hour without feeling suffocated like other masks. Of course they are not as light as procedure masks, but I don't think that's a reasonable expectation from a washable mask. They are also quite large, I have trouble wearing ""normal"" adult-sized masks, but these reach far down under the chin.Now the only (and major) drawback is they don't have a nose clip. I was sometimes able to push them under my glasses to diminish fogging, but it greatly reduced the comfort, and didn't hold in place for long. I ordered and installed metal nose strips to get around this problem, but I feel they should be part of the mask, in a seam, and not just glued on.

These mask are 2 ply for safety but I don't completely bake when wearing them.  They have a strong seam so the mask doesn't suck into my mouth.  The cut is large so the mask gives good coverage and allows for some air space inside.  My only concern is how the strings attach to the mask and how long they'll last.  Currently spent about $180.00 trying various masks.  They are my definite go to.

  I purchased this in XL, large would probably have fit better. I would say I have an 'average' size head, however most of the masks I've purchased have been too small. Every mask I've purchased ends up slipping off my nose, or moving around constantly. This fits great and I don't have that issue at all.I also wear glasses, so It's been an issue finding a mask that doesn't fog up my glasses. This doesn't have any material that will seal the top, but I've found that since this fits better, once tightened I have no issues with fogging. Great product!

  I have ordered the small, medium and XL sizes.  For my 6 year old, 9 year old, wife and myself. These masks do not work.  I have picked up masks from the corner store for less that work MUCH better (of course they are out of stock now).  They fit okay - until you open your mouth - once.  Then they fall off your nose forcing you to touch your face.  Furthermore - they do not reduce your breath enough to stop the blow out the candle test.  On top of all that - I feel hot and breathless when simply walking around with it on.  I have ordered others - and continue to use disposables for now.

  These were a total let down. They feel and look great, but the elastic is terribly cheap, different lengths and mishaped. I bought 2 packs of 3 small size for my kids (so I didn't need to sew anymore) & only 1 out of 6 fit either child correctly. However, if you can sew they're very easily improved upon. They don't have a wire for the nose, so it constantly slips down under the chin. I sewed a bag tie to the seam and that's fixed the slipping. However the elastic was so stretched out on a few that I had to add beads to them and sew the elastic ends together to keep the beads just to allow for adjustment. I'm being literal when I say the one elastic was so stretched it fit around my head to a high ponytail.

I went searching for something else affordable but good, so I got these. All in all it's still a mask - something that restricts your breathing BUT these are really good. I noticed a major difference! I put this on and had a deep sigh out and the hot air quickly escaped. My mouth does still get wet but that's inevitable. I didn't get a headache, and overall it was great to breathe in! For someone who hates restriction, I'm glad I found something I can withstand. I gave 4 stars because I have only used it one day. Im hoping the quality keeps up because they are comfy too!!

  Use these as my day to day have to go into a store mask. It fits well and covers the perfect amount of your face. A plus since I'm 6'5 and the mask is perfect. Only downside is it kinda sucks if you wear glasses. More of a problem with the kind of glasses I have as opposed to the mask. You will have to wear your glasses slightly low to keep them from fogging up, and if you don't have glasses that grab your ears properly, it can be annoying. Outside of that, it's my day to day mask out of the 5 kinds I own.

  I have easily spent over $100 on masks trying to find one that fits. I have a big face - ear to ear there is some might expansive geography. One size fits all masks don’t do it (unless you like dopey ears) and constantly slip off my nose or up off my chin.These masks fit comfortably from the bridge of my nose to well under my chin without being tight on the face or the ears (they still form well across the top and side, more so than the surgical type I’ve used). It is easy to breathe even though, like all masks, continued wear can get ‘moist’. I work in a school, so they’re on all day. That’s why I was happy to see the 3-pack.

  I have easily spent over $100 on masks trying to find one that fits. I have a big face - ear to ear there is some might expansive geography. One size fits all masks don’t do it (unless you like dopey ears) and constantly slip off my nose or up off my chin.These masks fit comfortably from the bridge of my nose to well under my chin without being tight on the face or the ears (they still form well across the top and side, more so than the surgical type I’ve used). It is easy to breathe even though, like all masks, continued wear can get ‘moist’. I work in a school, so they’re on all day. That’s why I was happy to see the 3-pack. The elastic is soft and comfortable.Best mask I’ve used so far.

  These are my favourite masks I've found so far. I have a big head and the Large size doesn't hurt the backs of my ears after hours of use like most other masks. I also do Uber Eats on my bicycle and the fact I can wear these all day is a huge plus. They are very breathable and lightweight. Recommended for work. They are extremely comfortable, light, breathable, and well-priced. I wish there were more colours.

  Sizing is very confusing.  If these are really Enerplex masks, then why is amazon’s size DIFFERENT than the Enerplex website’s???  Went with Amazon’s recommendation of Large as it states it fits most faces, but found they were much too big.  Wanted to exchange for smaller size but had to pay for shipping again.  Had to use needle and thread on them to manually fit my face.Other than this, masks are really soft, light and comfortable.  Would have given this a 4 out of 5 but for size and colour issues: colour is not really permanent.  Slight discolouration upon each wash.

  These masks fit neither a 3-year-old NOR a 9-year-old. I bought this pack of masks for my 9 year-old.  The height of the mask is so short, it will only cover his mouth OR his nose - not both.  It does cover my 3-year-old's nose and mouth.  So that's cool, I should be able to use the mask on my 3-year-old instead, right?  Wrong.  The mask is so wide and loops so long, it dangles off her face.  Silly and useless - built for a kid with a disproportionately short, wide head.

  Bought the XL mask because I've had bad experiences with masks shrinking in the dryer.After laundering the mask it was still big enough to fit my face.The absence of a nose wire is the only real weakness of this mask, but the way it is designed makes adding one quite easy -- the seam on the top edge of the mask forms a tube that holds a small piece of solid copper wire quite well (I cut some from some scrap 14 gauge household electrical wire)  I sanded the ends of the wire to remove any sharp edges, and was able to push them through the material into the seam, where they have been quite secure.  The ends could be fixed in place with some light sewing, but I have found the bend of the wire to be adequate to keep it in position, even after washing.

  Face masks are fine - they are a step up from the cheaper variety you will find on Amazon. I ordered the XL size, but they should not be called that - they are Large as compared to most other brands I've tried. Also, I ordered the 3 mask package in XL, but only 2 of the 3 masks were the correct size, and one was much smaller and doesn't fit.

  I expected good quality for the price and reviews given here. It feels really flimsy, especially the elastic band. The grip even on youth size on my face (adult- and I’m not even close to skinny) feels like it’ll fall off- which means it doesn’t grasp the face well and allows air to enter from everywhere.I’ll keep it since it’s a hassle to return, but I wouldn’t recommend it at all.

  I purchased the medium size as well as the large. As a women, I found the medium fit well for myself and the large was good for my husband. It’s possible that I could even fit the small. I would say that the medium is also good for kids aged from 12 and up.  If you have a child under 12, I would definitely go for the small size.

   I read reviews about this mask not passing the candle test. I tried it myself. I don't see how one can blow a candle with this mask on. The sunlight test was concerning though. I did see one too many sparkles... Also the mask smells. Not sure if that's the soap residue, but I don't think so.

  Ordered a 3pac of large masks and upon receipt of goods found there were two different sizes of masks in the package, only 1 of the size I ordered.  I contacted the supplier advised them if the issue and within a couple of days received a new package of 3 large masks. FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!The masks themselves are very comfortable, fit well around the bridge of the nose and the chin.  The elastic is not too tight around the ears, and being narrower than other mask elastic fits nicely in the groove behind your ear.  I would definitely recommend these masks.

  We are very happy with these. They are very comfortable. They are a very soft material, and they have a nice stretch where they do not feel tight, but there is no gaping and they don't tug behind the ears. They also have held up very nicely in the wash and I haven't had any issues throwing them in the dryer on low heat. I have washed them maybe 5 or 6 times and they are holding up so far. This is the third type of mask we purchased and by far the best, so we have repurchased and plan to buy some more.

  Waited a bit to leave a review, but it’s been a couple weeks now wearing these everyday and they've been great. Material is very soft and breathable. I work as an automotive mechanic and we’ve been mandated to wear masks at all times inside the building so I wear these masks for almost 8hrs straight. Got tired of the disposable ones real quick, but really like these ones. Thankfully our shop is air conditioned as my only complaint is they can get a bit hot, but I feel like that’s true with all masks once your working/sweating and breathing heavier etc. Did discover there’s an up and a down lol. Having the slightly larger “pocket” down seems to keep it on your chin better and prevents them from sliding up into your eyes. I‘ve been washing them by hand quickly in a bowl with some liquid detergent and they’ve kept their shape perfectly after hanging to dry overnight.

Mask fits my face nice and like how it fits around the nose and eyes. Very comfy and snug.  Packaging is really nice too with instructions on cleaning.

This step is absolutely necessary: I think they were powdered with charcoal for hygienic reason.The layers, that constitute the mask, feel a bit like a thin cushion, without obstructing my respiration. I find it quite comfortable, and do not hesitate to recommend this model.5 stars.

  This is the 5th type of facemask I've purchased and I may have finally found ""the one"". It's soft, scooped out enough under my eyes and washes beautifully. An extra bonus is the ear loops are not thick. If you wear glasses as I do there's less bulk on your ears. If you're having issues finding something that doesn't feel like someone has a pillow over your face, your constantly having to adjust so your glasses don't fog up with sore ears after a few hours, this may be the one. I also love the fact they come in different sizes. I purchased the small adult.

  I like the elastic bands that go behind the ear, it's smooth and unlike other masks on market, this mask does not pull/yank on the ears as you walk or cycle. It covers my face well, no gaps, no openings. There were some threads sticking out at corners, but they were easy to cut. The fabric itself is sewn well to the border trim, which I was concerned may be an issue.

  At first the mask seems fine, but wearing it in any sort of heat (summer), and/or for an extended amount of time gets really uncomfortable. Super hot and steamy... Plus when you breath the mask is heavy enough that it sucks in on your inhale. Wearing it for short periods is fine enough though. (5 hour shift serving at a bar, no. Half hour trip to the grocery store, sure).

  I do like the style and softness of these, but the sizing is quite frustrating. All 3 masks have a different shape/fit. One was slightly smaller in length from the nose to the chin so it tends to pull down a bit more when talking. One gaps open under the chin. One has excess fabric in the front because of the cut of the fabric (a more pronounced curvature). And I had to tie a knot in the ear elastics of all 3 to prevent them from falling off my face because they were too loose. I also wish that they had a wire in the nose for a more secure fit, so I will probably try buying a different brand next time.

Other masks with a straight edge rub my bottom eye lashes and bug me, but this one has just the right amount of curve to it not to push up too near the eyes.

  I discovered these masks while searching for youth masks for my youngest.  On the images provided it shows the purchaser how to select the most accurate size for your needs.  What I found unclear was aligning the children’s sizes with the adult sizes. The children’s mask image gave a description based on size and measurement and word labelling that didn’t match the options available when clicking on purchase so I selected the medium (which was the second size from the smallest).  I assumed that the medium matched the second size up in the children’s masks. The mediums came in and fit quite well for the adults in the home  (a tad big for doable) but were  too big for my child. I then ordered the small size. The size of the masks were a bit smaller and work with a bit of knotting in the ear loops.  The loop elastic material is much thinner and more flimsy in the small masks than the medium masks.  I must have ordered both sizes as adult masks.  In terms of comfort the masks are amazing! They are soft and conform very nicely to the face.  They are easy to wear for long periods of time. Great for those with sensitive skin! They wash well and maintain their shape. I purchased them because of the reviews. I would purchase them again.

  I discovered these masks while searching for youth masks for my youngest.  On the images provided it shows the purchaser how to select the most accurate size for your needs.  What I found unclear was aligning the children’s sizes with the adult sizes. The children’s mask image gave a description based on size and measurement and word labelling that didn’t match the options available when clicking on purchase so I selected the medium (which was the second size from the smallest).  I assumed that the medium matched the second size up in the children’s masks. The mediums came in and fit quite well for the adults in the home  (a tad big for doable) but were  too big for my child. I then ordered the small size. The size of the masks were a bit smaller and work with a bit of knotting in the ear loops.  The loop elastic material is much thinner and more flimsy in the small masks than the medium masks.  I must have ordered both sizes as adult masks.  In terms of comfort the masks are amazing!

  Comfortable to wear and carefully shaped to seal well around the top of the nose.  These masks provide good non-medical protection in the current unfortunate situation.  I've washed each of mine 4 times now and they are standing up well - perhaps just slightly less comfortable at the top but good for a while yet.  Definitely recommended.

  Bought these because reviews were great. Not sure if the reviewers were paid as these masks are terrible. The mask got very hot within about 5 minutes of wear and are not breathable at all. It was not a hot day today (approx. 16 degrees). I bought 3 of the medium for me and my 2 sons but I can't see my kids being able to wear these for a long time as its NOT BREATHABLE.

  Very happy with these masks!Measured my face per instructions; my measurement (5.5”) and my wife’s (4.75”) both fell in the “Large” range, so that’s what we ordered.  The masks are soft and very comfortable, and conform perfectly to my face.  Unlike every other ear-loop mask I’ve tried, these sit securely and comfortably around my ears, without pulling the tops of the ears down and slipping off.  I may have wimpy ears, or a long face that stretches other loops too tight; either way, this large mask finally solves that problem.  (For reference, measuring from the point of my chin to the spot on my ear that holds the loops, I get 7”.)The masks are soft and comfortable.  They seem breatheable (without feeling porous).  I think they’ll be comfortable for long periods.Also got great service from the vendor.  Received the wrong size initially, reached out to the vendor and they promptly and courteously expedited the correct masks to us, no questions asked.

  Other L/XL masks slipped off my husband's chin, especially if he spoke while wearing them which means they can't do what they are supposed to do to keep us all safe. These ones are comfortable and work like they are supposed to in public! He finds it a comfortable mask to wear, feels good around the ears, and doesn't fog up his glasses. Reasonably priced too. Recommended.

  Ordered a pack in Medium size, after checking the measurements. While finishing ordering, the basket  showed the item was youth/small adult. Tried few times by emptying the shopping basket and chosing the right size ‘Medium’, which would populate my basket without giving correct size info. Getting tired, I ordered anyways. Order received on time, size on the inside package marked as small. I had to wash it before trying for size verification. Sure enough, it’s a bit smaller. Medium size would have been perfect. Be Careful when ordering. The system should NOT fill our shopping basket with a different size if size required is out of stock. Stuck with something that can’t use.

  If you have to wear a mask, might as well wear one that is comfortable. These fit very well even after several wash cycles. I like the fact they are multi-layer and made of different fabric layers. In theory you get a soft yet ineffective inner layer, followed by more effective outer layers that you don't have to have rubbing against your face.

Good mouth and nose coverage, and no tension behind the ears. Overall a great option for mandatory face coverings!

  I found the size small was almost too small for my average size 5 year old. If you are looking for masks for kids I would recommend ordering the medium size. After hand washing the mask turned yellow when air dried. Not impressed for the price paid. I was able to find similar, if not better, quality masks at a local store for the fraction of the price. I would recommend only ordering the black in my opinion if you’re still tempted to purchase these.

I have worn other masks that leave my ears sore, but this does not happen. Also, breathable (considering). Lastly, I love to wear makeup and hate when masks remove it.

  They are quite expensive for having them shrink after the first wash. Even after following the instructions. So now I have to ""play"" a little bit with the position of the mask to cover from my nose to my chin without getting fog in my glasses. So I would recommend a bigger size so you can get the perfect fit after it shrinks.Mine are Large... It would've been better with XL.

  Better than expected. I was using the disposable ones but found that they would slip up my face while I was working. These don't do that. They are comfortable and stay put. Only issue is I paid $17 for 3 last week and this week it went up for $26???

  This is by far the best mask that I and my wife have purchased . She bought the same but only smaller than mine. The largest size you made is what I bought. It fits better is more comfortable and softer than any mask I have previously bought from another company.. If this Pandemic continues we will be definitely be buying It again through Amazon. The price of three masks sold together was very reasonable. Thanks Nancy & Don Graber Windsor Ont.o

  I got the XL mask because I have a rounder face, I read in a different comment that they do shrink in the wash. But this Intial fit I do like. Loose but I tied the ear loops so it’s a tighter fit to my face, overall for the price and quantity. I recommend it

  Excellent mask, comfortable and appears to be fairly durable construction, also nice its available in larger sized, only reason this didn't get 5 stars is there is a central raised seam running dead center down the middle of the inside of the mask which rest on the tip of your nose, its a little irritating at first but once you get used to it or wear it a bit to one side its no issue. Great product overall.

  Best mask I have used.  The fabric is really soft and the fit is perfect. They feel thick enough that I am confident they offer substantial protection.  There are no gaps anywhere when its on my face and I really like the shape of it.  I am a average sized woman and the medium fits perfectly as other masks I have bought in stores with a similar shape have been too big.  Glad I went with the medium size.  I would recommend these masks!

  Bought the L and fits well. The elastics for the ear loops are soft and very comfortable. I struggled with other 100% cotton masks as they were too restricting in breathability for me and absorbed too much moisture. These are much better.Only downside is that one of the masks had some dirt on the inside which was weird. So I highly recommend washing them thoroughly before wearing.

  These masks are soft and comfortable in the short term as long as you’re not wearing glasses.  Since they lack a nose wire they direct a lot of exhaled air upwards which fogs your lenses.  In the long term the material used causes a lot of moisture build up on your face.

  I have been looking for a mask that can nicely fit my face and beard, this is the first in a handful of orders that finally works well. I don't have a larger than normal head, but most masks don't seem to want to fit well with a thick beard and these masks do the trick. They are a bit warm, but I'd rather have a mask that fits and deal with the warmth vs having a mask that doesn't fit or do it's job. I was happy enough with them to order a second package, giving me enough masks to do my work week.

I was less impressed with the customer support as I emailed them and no reply. I understand you can receive faulty products sometimes, but what makes a company is how they support the customer.

  Purchased the masks thinking they're higher quality. The earband came off the fabric on first use. They use a cheap elastic-band type attachment. Other masks i've used have a cloth ear band. The ear bands are also small and pull on your ears (even though I ordered a LARGE mask).Large mask is small... order a size up

  Very comfortable. Curved so that it fits over your nose and chin comfortably. Multiple layers and passes the candle test so it feels safe even though it's very soft. The ear loops are comfy and stretchy and doesn't hurt your ears. I was in between medium and large on the size chart (4.4 inches) so I sized up and it fits comfortably, so I recommend sizing up if you're near the boundaries on the chart.

I've washed them each twice (not noticing any shrinking) but just noticed the stitching coming off on one mask already at work. I'll double check the other 2 when I get home but hopefully this is an isolated incident.

  These masks are wonderful - absolutely zero complaints about the product functionality/quality itself. However, though I ordered one pack of the blue in size M and one pack of the white in size M, the white are significantly smaller, to the point that they hurt my ears. I suspect I was sent a size S in the white, which is disappointing as I love these masks and they were not cheap. But the white are practically unwearable.

  The XL size is a great fit if you're needing more than a standard mask. The standard masks don't provide enough coverage normally. This fits well at the nose and chin. The ear loops hold well. It is very soft and comfortable to wear. I bought masks from three different suppliers and these outmatched the others and were the 2nd cheapest (per mask) of the three. I'll be buying more.

  Absolutely fantastic masks. Very strong and durable. I machine wash them with no issues at all. And for a guy who had a head bigger then a child (feels like all other masks are sized for incredibly small people), these XL masks fit great. I 100% reccomend. I wear them all day at my airport job.

  Fit and quality is good, not great the only thing is the bands are too loose for adult or youth size they keep falling off.  I wish it had adjustable bands.  I just tied a knot to shorten the bands length for my kid and it works fine. If your kid is wearing glasses it will fog up.

  Given the high price I expected a top quailty mask. It does feel comfortable but lacks a nose wire/metal strip so a large space is open between the mask and face near the nose. That defeats the purpose? Maybe a larger size would help but I used the sizing guide.
